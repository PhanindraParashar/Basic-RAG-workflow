This paper presents a\\nnew set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support\\nmultilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with\\n405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive\\nempirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language\\nmodels such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and\\npost-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input\\nand output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image,\\nvideo, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach\\nperforms competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The\\nresulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.\\nDate: July 23, 2024\\nWebsite: https://llama.meta.com/\\n1 Introduction\\nFoundation models are general models of language, vision, speech, and/or other modalities that are designed\\nto support a large variety of AI tasks. They form the basis of many modern AI systems.\\nThe development of modern foundation models consists of two main stages:(1) a pre-training stage in which\\nthe model is trained at massive scale using straightforward tasks such as next-word prediction or captioning\\nand (2) a post-training stage in which the model is tuned to follow instructions, align with human preferences,\\nand improve specific capabilities (for example, coding and reasoning).\\nIn this paper, we present a new set of foundation models for language, calledLlama 3. The Llama 3 Herd\\nof models natively supports multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is dense\\nTransformer with 405B parameters, processing information in a context window of up to 128K tokens. Each\\nmember of the herd is listed in Table 1. All the results presented in this paper are for the Llama 3.1 models,\\nwhich we will refer to as Llama 3 throughout for brevity.\\nWe believe there are three key levers in the development of high-quality foundation models: data, scale, and\\nmanaging complexity. We seek to optimize for these three levers in our development process:\\n• Data. Compared to prior versions of Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a,b), we improved both the quantity and\\nqualityofthedataweuseforpre-trainingandpost-training. Theseimprovementsincludethedevelopment\\nof more careful pre-processing and curation pipelines for pre-training data and the development of more\\nrigorous quality assurance and filtering approaches for post-training data. We pre-train Llama 3 on a\\ncorpus of about 15T multilingual tokens, compared to 1.8T tokens for Llama 2.\\n• Scale. We train a model at far larger scale than previous Llama models: our flagship language model was\\npre-trained using3.8 × 1025 FLOPs, almost50× more than the largest version of Llama 2. Specifically,\\nwe pre-trained a flagship model with 405B trainable parameters on 15.6T text tokens. As expected per\\n1\\narXiv:2407.21783v3  [cs.AI]  23 Nov 2024'),\n",

While our scaling laws suggest our flagship model is an approximately compute-optimal\\nsize for our training budget, we also train our smaller models for much longer than is compute-optimal.\\nThe resulting models perform better than compute-optimal models at the same inference budget. We\\nuse the flagship model to further improve the quality of those smaller models during post-training.\\n• Managing complexity. We make design choices that seek to maximize our ability to scale the model\\ndevelopment process. For example, we opt for a standard dense Transformer model architecture (Vaswani\\net al., 2017) with minor adaptations, rather than for a mixture-of-experts model (Shazeer et al., 2017)\\nto maximize training stability. Similarly, we adopt a relatively simple post-training procedure based\\non supervised finetuning (SFT), rejection sampling (RS), and direct preference optimization (DPO;\\nRafailov et al. (2023)) as opposed to more complex reinforcement learning algorithms (Ouyang et al.,\\n2022; Schulman et al., 2017) that tend to be less stable and harder to scale.\\nThe result of our work is Llama 3: a herd of three multilingual1 language models with 8B, 70B, and 405B\\nparameters. We evaluate the performance of Llama 3 on a plethora of benchmark datasets that span a wide\\nrange of language understanding tasks. In addition, we perform extensive human evaluations that compare\\nLlama 3 with competing models. An overview of the performance of the flagship Llama 3 model on key\\nbenchmarks is presented in Table 2. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our flagship model performs\\non par with leading language models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a) across a variety of tasks, and is close to\\nmatching the state-of-the-art. Our smaller models are best-in-class, outperforming alternative models with\\nsimilar numbers of parameters (Bai et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). Llama 3 also delivers a much better\\nbalance between helpfulness and harmlessness than its predecessor (Touvron et al., 2023b). We present a\\ndetailed analysis of the safety of Llama 3 in Section 5.4.\\nWe are publicly releasing all three Llama 3 models under an updated version of the Llama 3 Community License;\\nsee https://llama.meta.com. This includes pre-trained and post-trained versions of our 405B parameter\\nlanguage model and a new version of our Llama Guard model (Inan et al., 2023) for input and output safety.\\nWe hope that the open release of a flagship model will spur a wave of innovation in the research community,\\nand accelerate a responsible path towards the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI).\\nAs part of the Llama 3 development process we also develop multimodal extensions to the models, enabling\\nimage recognition, video recognition, and speech understanding capabilities. These models are still under\\nactive development and not yet ready for release. In addition to our language modeling results, the paper\\npresents results of our initial experiments with those multimodal models.\\n1The Llama 3 8B and 70B were pre-trained on multilingual data but were intended for use in English at the time.\\n2'),\n",

The development of our Llama 3 language\\nmodels comprises two main stages:\\n• Language model pre-training. We start by converting a large, multilingual text corpus to discrete tokens\\nand pre-training a large language model (LLM) on the resulting data to perform next-token prediction.\\nIn the language model pre-training stage, the model learns the structure of language and obtains large\\namounts of knowledge about the world from the text it is “reading”. To do this effectively, pre-training\\nis performed at massive scale: we pre-train a model with 405B parameters on 15.6T tokens using a\\ncontext window of 8K tokens. This standard pre-training stage is followed by a continued pre-training\\nstage that increases the supported context window to 128K tokens. See Section 3 for details.\\n• Language model post-training. The pre-trained language model has a rich understanding of language\\nbut it does not yet follow instructions or behave in the way we would expect an assistant to. We\\nalign the model with human feedback in several rounds, each of which involves supervised finetuning\\n(SFT) on instruction tuning data and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024).\\nAt this post-training2 stage, we also integrate new capabilities, such as tool-use, and observe strong\\nimprovements in other areas, such as coding and reasoning. See Section 4 for details. Finally, safety\\nmitigations are also incorporated into the model at the post-training stage, the details of which are\\ndescribed in Section 5.4.\\nThe resulting models have a rich set of capabilities. They can answer questions in at least eight languages,\\nwrite high-quality code, solve complex reasoning problems, and use tools out-of-the-box or in a zero-shot way.\\nWe also perform experiments in which we add image, video, and speech capabilities to Llama 3 using a\\ncompositional approach. The approach we study comprises the three additional stages illustrated in Figure 28:\\n• Multi-modal encoder pre-training. We train separate encoders for images and speech. We train our\\nimage encoder on large amounts of image-text pairs. This teaches the model the relation between visual\\ncontent and the description of that content in natural language. Our speech encoder is trained using a\\n2In this paper, we use the term “post-training” to refer to any model training that happens outside of pre-training.\\n3'),\n",

As a result, the model learns the structure of speech\\nsignals. See Section 7 for details on the image encoder and Section 8 for details on the speech encoder.\\n• Vision adapter training. We train an adapter that integrates the pre-trained image encoder into the\\npre-trained language model. The adapter consists of a series of cross-attention layers that feed image-\\nencoder representations into the language model. The adapter is trained on text-image pairs. This\\naligns the image representations with the language representations. During adapter training, we also\\nupdate the parameters of the image encoder but we intentionally do not update the language-model\\nparameters. We also train a video adapter on top of the image adapter on paired video-text data. This\\nenables the model to aggregate information across frames. See Section 7 for details.\\n• Speech adapter training. Finally, we integrate the speech encoder into the model via an adapter that\\nconverts speech encodings into token representations that can be fed directly into the finetuned language\\nmodel. The parameters of the adapter and encoder are jointly updated in a supervised finetuning stage\\nto enable high-quality speech understanding. We do not change the language model during speech\\nadapter training. We also integrate a text-to-speech system. See Section 8 for details.\\nOur multimodal experiments lead to models that can recognize the content of images and videos, and support\\ninteraction via a speech interface. These models are still under development and not yet ready for release.\\n3 Pre-Training\\nLanguage model pre-training involves:(1) the curation and filtering of a large-scale training corpus,(2) the\\ndevelopment of a model architecture and corresponding scaling laws for determining model size,(3) the\\ndevelopment of techniques for efficient pre-training at large scale, and(4) the development of a pre-training\\nrecipe. We present each of these components separately below.\\n3.1 Pre-Training Data\\nWe create our dataset for language model pre-training from a variety of data sources containing knowledge\\nuntil the end of 2023. We apply several de-duplication methods and data cleaning mechanisms on each data\\nsource to obtain high-quality tokens. We remove domains that contain large amounts of personally identifiable\\ninformation (PII), and domains with known adult content.\\n3.1.1 Web Data Curation\\nMuch of the data we utilize is obtained from the web and we describe our cleaning process below.\\nPII and safety filtering. Among other mitigations, we implement filters designed to remove data from websites\\nare likely to contain unsafe content or high volumes of PII, domains that have been ranked as harmful\\naccording to a variety of Meta safety standards, and domains that are known to contain adult content.\\n4'),\n",

We process the raw HTML content for non-truncated web documents to extract\\nhigh-quality diverse text. To do so, we build a custom parser that extracts the HTML content and optimizes\\nfor precision in boilerplate removal and content recall. We evaluate our parser’s quality in human evaluations,\\ncomparing it with popular third-party HTML parsers that optimize for article-like content, and found it\\nto perform favorably. We carefully process HTML pages with mathematics and code content to preserve\\nthe structure of that content. We maintain the imagealt attribute text since mathematical content is often\\nrepresented as pre-rendered images where the math is also provided in thealt attribute. We experimentally\\nevaluate different cleaning configurations. We find markdown is harmful to the performance of a model that\\nis primarily trained on web data compared to plain text, so we remove all markdown markers.\\nDe-duplication. We apply several rounds of de-duplication at the URL, document, and line level:\\n• URL-level de-duplication. We perform URL-level de-duplication across the entire dataset. We keep the\\nmost recent version for pages corresponding to each URL.\\n• Document-level de-duplication. We perform global MinHash (Broder, 1997) de-duplication across the\\nentire dataset to remove near duplicate documents.\\n• Line-level de-duplication. We perform aggressive line-level de-duplication similar toccNet (Wenzek\\net al., 2019). We remove lines that appeared more than 6 times in each bucket of 30M documents.\\nAlthough our manual qualitative analysis showed that the line-level de-duplication removes not only\\nleftover boilerplate from various websites such as navigation menus, cookie warnings, but also frequent\\nhigh-quality text, our empirical evaluations showed strong improvements.\\nHeuristic filtering. We develop heuristics to remove additional low-quality documents, outliers, and documents\\nwith excessive repetitions. Some examples of heuristics include:\\n• We use duplicated n-gram coverage ratio (Rae et al., 2021) to remove lines that consist of repeated\\ncontent such as logging or error messages. Those lines could be very long and unique, hence cannot be\\nfiltered by line-dedup.\\n• We use “dirty word” counting (Raffel et al., 2020) to filter out adult websites that are not covered by\\ndomain block lists.\\n• We use a token-distribution Kullback-Leibler divergence to filter out documents containing excessive\\nnumbers of outlier tokens compared to the training corpus distribution.\\nModel-based quality filtering. Further, we experiment with applying various model-based quality classifiers\\nto sub-select high-quality tokens. These include using fast classifiers such asfasttext (Joulin et al., 2017)\\ntrained to recognize if a given text would be referenced by Wikipedia (Touvron et al., 2023a), as well as more\\ncompute-intensive Roberta-based classifiers (Liu et al., 2019a) trained on Llama 2 predictions. To train a\\nquality classifier based on Llama 2, we create a training set of cleaned web documents, describe the quality\\nrequirements, and instruct Llama 2’s chat model to determine if the documents meets these requirements. We\\nuse DistilRoberta (Sanh et al., 2019) to generate quality scores for each document for efficiency reasons. We\\nexperimentally evaluate the efficacy of various quality filtering configurations.\\nCode and reasoning data. Similar to DeepSeek-AI et al. (2024), we build domain-specific pipelines that extract\\ncode and math-relevant web pages. Specifically, both the code and reasoning classifiers are DistilRoberta\\nmodels trained on web data annotated by Llama 2. Unlike the general quality classifier mentioned above, we\\nconduct prompt tuning to target web pages containing math deduction, reasoning in STEM areas and code\\ninterleaved with natural language. Since the token distribution of code and math is substantially different\\nthan that of natural language, these pipelines implement domain-specific HTML extraction, customized text\\nfeatures and heuristics for filtering.\\nMultilingual data.

We determine the amount of multilingual tokens used in\\npre-training experimentally, balancing model performance on English and multilingual benchmarks.\\n3.1.2 Determining the Data Mix\\nTo obtain a high-quality language model, it is essential to carefully determine the proportion of different data\\nsources in the pre-training data mix. Our main tools in determining this data mix are knowledge classification\\nand scaling law experiments.\\nKnowledge classification. We develop a classifier to categorize the types of information contained in our web\\ndata to more effectively determine a data mix. We use this classifier to downsample data categories that are\\nover-represented on the web, for example, arts and entertainment.\\nScaling laws for data mix. To determine the best data mix, we perform scaling law experiments in which we\\ntrain several small models on a data mix and use that to predict the performance of a large model on that mix\\n(see Section 3.2.1). We repeat this process multiple times for different data mixes to select a new data mix\\ncandidate. Subsequently, we train a larger model on this candidate data mix and evaluate the performance of\\nthat model on several key benchmarks.\\nData mix summary. Our final data mix contains roughly 50% of tokens corresponding to general knowledge,\\n25% of mathematical and reasoning tokens, 17% code tokens, and 8% multilingual tokens.\\n3.1.3 Annealing Data\\nEmpirically, we find that annealing (see Section 3.4.3) on small amounts of high-quality code and mathematical\\ndata can boost the performance of pre-trained models on key benchmarks. Akin to Li et al. (2024b), we\\nperform annealing with a data mix that upsamples high-quality data in select domains. We do not include\\nany training sets from commonly used benchmarks in our annealing data. This enables us to assess the true\\nfew-shot learning capabilities and out-of-domain generalization of Llama 3.\\nFollowing OpenAI (2023a), we evaluate the efficacy of annealing on the GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021) and\\nMATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) training sets in annealing. We find that annealing improved the performance\\nof a pre-trained Llama 3 8B model on the GSM8k and MATH validation sets by 24.0% and 6.4%, respectively.\\nHowever, the improvements on the 405B model are negligible, suggesting that our flagship model has strong\\nin-context learning and reasoning capabilities and does not require specific in-domain training samples to\\nobtain strong performance.\\nUsing annealing to assess data quality. Similar to Blakeney et al. (2024), we find that annealing enables us to\\njudge the value of small domain-specific datasets. We measure the value of such datasets by annealing the\\nlearning rate of a 50% trained Llama 3 8B model linearly to 0 on 40B tokens. In those experiments, we assign\\n30% weight to the new dataset and the remaining 70% weight to the default data mix. Using annealing to\\nevaluate new data sources is more efficient than performing scaling law experiments for every small dataset.\\n3.2 Model Architecture\\nLlama 3 uses a standard, dense Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). It does not deviate significantly\\nfrom Llama and Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023a,b) in terms of model architecture; our performance gains are\\nprimarily driven by improvements in data quality and diversity as well as by increased training scale.\\nWe make a few small modifications compared to Llama 2:\\n• We use grouped query attention (GQA; Ainslie et al. (2023)) with 8 key-value heads to improve inference\\nspeed and to reduce the size of key-value caches during decoding.\\n• We use an attention mask that prevents self-attention between different documents within the same\\nsequence. We find that this change had limited impact during in standard pre-training, but find it to be\\nimportant in continued pre-training on very long sequences.\\n6'),\n",

This leads to a model size that is approximately compute-optimal\\naccording to scaling laws on our data for our training budget of3.8 × 1025 FLOPs.\\n3.2.1 Scaling Laws\\nWe develop scaling laws (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020) to determine the optimal model size for\\nour flagship model given our pre-training compute budget. In addition to determining the optimal model size,\\na major challenge is to forecast the flagship model’s performance on downstream benchmark tasks, due to a\\ncouple of issues: (1) Existing scaling laws typically predict only next-token prediction loss rather than specific\\nbenchmark performance. (2) Scaling laws can be noisy and unreliable because they are developed based on\\npre-training runs conducted with small compute budgets (Wei et al., 2022b).\\nTo address these challenges, we implement a two-stage methodology to develop scaling laws that accurately\\npredict downstream benchmark performance:\\n1. We first establish a correlation between the compute-optimal model’s negative log-likelihood on down-\\nstream tasks and the training FLOPs.\\n2. Next, we correlate the negative log-likelihood on downstream tasks with task accuracy, utilizing both the\\nscaling law models and older models trained with higher compute FLOPs. In this step, we specifically\\nleverage the Llama 2 family of models.\\nThis approach enables us to predict downstream task performance given a specific number of training FLOPs\\nfor compute-optimal models. We use a similar method to select our pre-training data mix (see Section 3.4).\\nScaling law experiments. Concretely, we construct our scaling laws by pre-training models using compute\\nbudgets between6 × 1018 FLOPs and1022 FLOPs. At each compute budget, we pre-train models ranging\\nin size between 40M and 16B parameters, using a subset of model sizes at each compute budget. In these\\ntraining runs, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with a linear warmup for 2,000 training steps. The peak\\nlearning rate is set between2 × 10−4 and 4 × 10−4 depending on the size of the model. We set the cosine\\ndecay to 0.1 of the peak value. The weight decay at each step is set to 0.1 times the learning rate at that step.\\nWe use a fixed batch size for each compute scale, ranging between 250K and 4M.\\n3https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/tree/main\\n7'),\n",

Llama 3 405B is trained on up to 16K H100 GPUs, each running at 700W TDP with 80GB HBM3,\\nusing Meta’s Grand Teton AI server platform (Matt Bowman, 2022). Each server is equipped with eight GPUs\\nand two CPUs. Within a server, the eight GPUs are connected via NVLink. Training jobs are scheduled\\nusing MAST (Choudhury et al., 2024), Meta’s global-scale training scheduler.\\nStorage. Tectonic (Pan et al., 2021), Meta’s general-purpose distributed file system, is used to build a storage\\nfabric (Battey and Gupta, 2024) for Llama 3 pre-training. It offers 240 PB of storage out of 7,500 servers\\nequipped with SSDs, and supports a sustainable throughput of 2 TB/s and a peak throughput of 7 TB/s. A\\nmajor challenge is supporting the highly bursty checkpoint writes that saturate the storage fabric for short\\ndurations. Checkpointing saves each GPU’s model state, ranging from 1 MB to 4 GB per GPU, for recovery\\nand debugging. We aim to minimize GPU pause time during checkpointing and increase checkpoint frequency\\nto reduce the amount of lost work after a recovery.\\nNetwork. Llama 3 405B used RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) fabric based on the Arista 7800\\nand Minipack2 Open Compute Project4 OCP rack switches. Smaller models in the Llama 3 family were\\ntrained using Nvidia Quantum2 Infiniband fabric. Both RoCE and Infiniband clusters leverage 400 Gbps\\ninterconnects between GPUs. Despite the underlying network technology differences between these clusters,\\nwe tune both of them to provide equivalent performance for these large training workloads. We elaborate\\nfurther on our RoCE network since we fully own its design.\\n• Network topology. Our RoCE-based AI cluster comprises 24K GPUs5 connected by a three-layer Clos\\nnetwork (Lee et al., 2024). At the bottom layer, each rack hosts 16 GPUs split between two servers and\\nconnected by a single Minipack2 top-of-the-rack (ToR) switch. In the middle layer, 192 such racks are\\nconnected by Cluster Switches to form a pod of 3,072 GPUs with full bisection bandwidth, ensuring no\\noversubscription. At the top layer, eight such pods within the same datacenter building are connected via\\nAggregation Switches to form a cluster of 24K GPUs. However, network connectivity at the aggregation\\nlayer does not maintain full bisection bandwidth and instead has an oversubscription ratio of 1:7. Our\\nmodel parallelism methods (see Section 3.3.2) and training job scheduler (Choudhury et al., 2024) are\\nall optimized to be aware of network topology, aiming to minimize network communication across pods.\\n• Load balancing. LLM training produces fat network flows that are hard to load balance across all\\navailable network paths using traditional methods such as Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) routing. To\\naddress this challenge, we employ two techniques. First, our collective library creates 16 network flows\\nbetween two GPUs, instead of just one, thereby reducing the traffic per flow and providing more flows\\n4Open Compute Project:https://www.opencompute.org/\\n5Note that we use only up to 16K of these 24K GPUs for Llama 3 pre-training.\\n9'),\n",

Second, our Enhanced-ECMP (E-ECMP) protocol effectively balances these 16 flows\\nacross different network paths by hashing on additional fields in the RoCE header of packets.\\n• Congestion control.

This setup helps\\nlimit the impact of persistent congestion and network back pressure caused by slow servers, which is\\ncommon in training. Finally, better load balancing through E-ECMP significantly reduces the chance\\nof congestion. With these optimizations, we successfully run a 24K GPU cluster without traditional\\ncongestion control methods such as Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification (DCQCN).\\n3.3.2 Parallelism for Model Scaling\\nTo scale training for our largest models, we use 4D parallelism—a combination of four different types of\\nparallelism methods—to shard the model. This approach efficiently distributes computation across many\\nGPUs and ensures each GPU’s model parameters, optimizer states, gradients, and activations fit in its\\nHBM. Our implementation of 4D parallelism is illustrated in Figure 5. It combines tensor parallelism (TP;\\nKrizhevsky et al. (2012); Shoeybi et al. (2019); Korthikanti et al. (2023)), pipeline parallelism (PP; Huang\\net al. (2019); Narayanan et al. (2021); Lamy-Poirier (2023)), context parallelism (CP; Liu et al. (2023a)), and\\ndata parallelism (DP; Rajbhandari et al. (2020); Ren et al. (2021); Zhao et al. (2023b)).\\nTensor parallelism splits individual weight tensors into multiple chunks on different devices. Pipeline parallelism\\npartitions the model vertically into stages by layers, so that different devices can process in parallel different\\nstages of the full model pipeline. Context parallelism divides the input context into segments, reducing memory\\nbottleneck for very long sequence length inputs. We use fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP; Rajbhandari\\net al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023b), which shards the model, optimizer, and gradients while\\nimplementing data parallelism which processes data in parallel on multiple GPUs and synchronizes after each\\ntraining step. Our use of FSDP for Llama 3 shards optimizer states and gradients, but for model shards we do\\nnot reshard after forward computation to avoid an extraall-gather communication during backward passes.\\nGPU utilization. Through careful tuning of the parallelism configuration, hardware, and software, we achieve\\nan overall BF16 Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU; Chowdhery et al. (2023)) of 38-43% for the configurations\\nshown in Table 4. The slight drop in MFU to 41% on 16K GPUs with DP=128 compared to 43% on 8K\\nGPUs with DP=64 is due to the lower batch size per DP group needed to keep the global tokens per batch\\nconstant during training.\\nPipeline parallelism improvements. We encountered several challenges with existing implementations:\\n• Batch size constraint. Current implementations have constraints on supported batch size per GPU,\\nrequiring it to be divisible by the number of pipeline stages. For the example in Figure 6, the depth-first\\nschedule (DFS) of pipeline parallelism (Narayanan et al., 2021) requiresN = PP = 4, while the\\nbreadth-first schedule (BFS; Lamy-Poirier (2023)) requiresN = M, where M is the total number\\nof micro-batches andN is the number of contiguous micro-batches for the same stage’s forward or\\nbackward. However, pre-training often needs flexibility to adjust batch size.\\n• Memory imbalance. Existing pipeline parallelism implementations lead to imbalanced resource consump-\\ntion. The first stage consumes more memory due to the embedding and the warm-up micro-batches.\\n• Computation imbalance. After the last layer of the model, we need to calculate output and loss, making\\nthis stage the execution latency bottleneck.\\n10'),\n",

The outermost parallelism may spread\\nacross a multi-hop network and should tolerate higher network latency. Therefore, based on the requirements\\nfor network bandwidth and latency, we place parallelism dimensions in the order of [TP, CP, PP, DP]. DP\\n(i.e., FSDP) is the outermost parallelism because it can tolerate longer network latency by asynchronously\\nprefetching sharded model weights and reducing gradients. Identifying the optimal parallelism configuration\\nwith minimal communication overhead while avoiding GPU memory overflow is challenging. We develop a\\nmemory consumption estimator and a performance-projection tool which helped us explore various parallelism\\nconfigurations and project overall training performance and identify memory gaps effectively.\\nNumerical stability. By comparing training loss between different parallelism setups, we fixed several numerical\\nissues that impact training stability. To ensure training convergence, we use FP32 gradient accumulation\\nduring backward computation over multiple micro-batches and alsoreduce-scatter gradients in FP32 across\\ndata parallel workers in FSDP. For intermediate tensors,e.g., vision encoder outputs, that are used multiple\\ntimes in the forward computation, the backward gradients are also accumulated in FP32.\\n3.3.3 Collective Communication\\nOur collective communication library for Llama 3 is based on a fork of Nvidia’s NCCL library, called NCCLX.\\nNCCLX significantly improves the performance of NCCL, especially for higher latency networks. Recall that\\nthe order of parallelism dimensions is [TP, CP, PP, DP], where DP corresponds to FSDP. The outermost\\nparallelism dimensions, PP and DP, may communicate through a multi-hop network, with latency up to tens\\nof microseconds. The original NCCL collectives—all-gather and reduce-scatter in FSDP, andpoint-to-point\\nin PP—require data chunking and staged data copy. This approach incurs several inefficiencies, including\\n(1) requiring a large number of small control messages to be exchanged over the network to facilitate data\\ntransfer, (2) extra memory-copy operations, and (3) using extra GPU cycles for communication. For Llama 3\\ntraining, we address a subset of these inefficiencies by tuning chunking and data transfer to fit our network\\nlatencies, which can be as high as tens of microseconds for a large cluster. We also allow small control messages\\nto traverse our network at a higher priority, especially avoiding being head-of-line blocked in deep-buffer\\ncore switches. Our ongoing work for future Llama versions involves making deeper changes in NCCLX to\\nholistically address all the aforementioned problems.\\n12'),\n",

Moreover, the synchronous nature of training makes it less fault-tolerant—a single\\nGPU failure may require a restart of the entire job. Despite these challenges, for Llama 3, we achieved higher\\nthan 90% effective training time while supporting automated cluster maintenance, such as firmware and Linux\\nkernel upgrades (Vigraham and Leonhardi, 2024), which resulted in at least one training interruption daily.\\nThe effective training time measures the time spent on useful training over the elapsed time.\\nDuring a 54-day snapshot period of pre-training, we experienced a total of 466 job interruptions. Of these, 47\\nwere planned interruptions due to automated maintenance operations such as firmware upgrades or operator-\\ninitiated operations like configuration or dataset updates. The remaining 419 were unexpected interruptions,\\nwhich are classified in Table 5. Approximately 78% of the unexpected interruptions are attributed to confirmed\\nhardware issues, such as GPU or host component failures, or suspected hardware-related issues like silent data\\ncorruption and unplanned individual host maintenance events. GPU issues are the largest category, accounting\\nfor 58.7% of all unexpected issues. Despite the large number of failures, significant manual intervention was\\nrequired only three times during this period, with the rest of issues handled by automation.\\nTo increase the effective training time, we reduced job startup and checkpointing time, and developed tools\\nfor fast diagnosis and problem resolution. We extensively use PyTorch’s built-in NCCL flight recorder (Ansel\\net al., 2024), a feature that captures collective metadata and stack traces into a ring buffer, and hence allowing\\nus to diagnose hangs and performance issues quickly at scale, particularly with regard to NCCLX. Using\\nthis, we efficiently record every communication event and the duration of each collective operation, and also\\nautomatically dump tracing data on NCCLX watchdog or heartbeat timeout. We enable more computationally\\nintensive tracing operations and metadata collection selectively as needed live in production through online\\nconfiguration changes (Tang et al., 2015) without needing a code release or job restart.\\nDebugging issues in large-scale training is complicated by the mixed use of NVLink and RoCE in our network.\\nData transfer over NVLink typically occurs through load/store operations issued by CUDA kernels, and\\nfailures in either the remote GPU or NVLink connectivity often manifest as stalled load/store operations\\nwithin CUDA kernels without returning a clear error code.

The three stages are described separately below. We use similar recipes to\\npre-train the 8B and 70B models.\\n3.4.1 Initial Pre-Training\\nWe pre-train Llama 3 405B using AdamW with a peak learning rate of8 × 10−5 , a linear warm up of 8,000\\nsteps, and a cosine learning rate schedule decaying to8 × 10−7 over 1,200,000 steps. We use a lower batch size\\nearly in training to improve training stability, and increase it subsequently to improve efficiency. Specifically,\\nwe use an initial batch size of 4M tokens and sequences of length 4,096, and double these values to a batch\\nsize of 8M sequences of 8,192 tokens after pre-training 252M tokens. We double the batch size again to 16M\\nafter pre-training on 2.87T tokens. We found this training recipe to be very stable: we observed few loss\\nspikes and did not require interventions to correct for model training divergence.\\nAdjusting the data mix. We made a several adjustments to the pre-training data mix during training to improve\\nmodel performance on particular downstream tasks. In particular, we increased the percentage of non-English\\ndata during pre-training to improve the multilingual performance of Llama 3. We also upsample mathematical\\ndata to improve the model’s mathematical reasoning performance, we added more recent web data in the\\nlater stages of pre-training to advance the model’s knowledge cut-off, and we downsampled subsets of the\\npre-training data that were later identified as being lower quality.\\n3.4.2 Long Context Pre-Training\\nIn the final stages of pre-training, we train on long sequences to support context windows of up to 128K tokens.\\nWe do not train on long sequences earlier because the compute in self-attention layers grows quadratically in\\nthe sequence length. We increase the supported context length in increments, pre-training until the model has\\nsuccessfully adapted to the increased context length. We assess successful adaptation by measuring whether(1)\\nmodel performance on short-context evaluations has recovered completely and(2) the model perfectly solves\\n“needle in a haystack” tasks up to that length. In Llama 3 405B pre-training, we increased context length\\ngradually in six stages, starting from the original 8K context window and ending in the final 128K context\\nwindow. This long-context pre-training stage was performed using approximately 800B training tokens.\\n14'),\n",

Our post-training strategy involves rejection sampling,\\nsupervised finetuning, and direct preference optimization. See text for details.\\n3.4.3 Annealing\\nDuring pre-training on the final 40M tokens, we linearly annealed the learning rate to 0, maintaining a context\\nlength of 128K tokens. During this annealing phase, we also adjusted the data mix to upsample data sources\\nof very high quality; see Section 3.1.3. Finally, we compute the average of model checkpoints (Polyak (1991)\\naveraging) during annealing to produce the final pre-trained model.\\n4 Post-Training\\nWe produce the aligned Llama 3 models by applying several rounds of post-training,6 or aligning the model\\nwith human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2024) on top of a pre-trained checkpoint. Each\\nround of post-training involves supervised finetuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO;\\nRafailov et al., 2024) on examples collected either via human annotations or generated synthetically. Our\\npost-training modeling and data approaches are described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 respectively. We further\\ndetail custom data curation strategies to improve the reasoning, coding, factuality, multilingual, tool use, long\\ncontext, and precise instruction following in Section 4.3.\\n4.1 Modeling\\nThe backbone of our post-training strategy is a reward model and a language model. We first train a reward\\nmodel on top of the pre-trained checkpoint using human-annotated preference data (see Section 4.1.2). We\\nthen finetune pre-trained checkpoints with supervised finetuning (SFT; see Section 4.1.3), and further align\\nthe checkpoints with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; see Section 4.1.4). This process is illustrated\\nin Figure 7. Unless otherwise noted, our modeling procedure applies to Llama 3 405B, and we refer to\\nLlama 3 405B as Llama 3 for simplicity.\\n4.1.1 Chat Dialog Format\\nTo tune LLMs for human-AI interaction, we need to define a chat dialog protocol for the model to understand\\nhuman instructions and perform conversational tasks. Compared to its predecessor, Llama 3 has new\\ncapabilities such as tool use (Section 4.3.5) which may require generating multiple messages and sending\\n6We use the term “post-training” to refer to any model training that happens outside of pre-training.\\n15'),\n",

To support this, we design a new\\nmulti-message chat protocol which uses various special header and termination tokens. The header tokens\\nare used to indicate the source and destination of each message in a conversation. Similarly, the termination\\ntokens indicate when it is the time to alternate between human and AI to speak.\\n4.1.2 Reward Modeling\\nWe train a reward model (RM) covering different capabilities on top of the pre-trained checkpoint. The\\ntraining objective is the same as Llama 2 except that we remove the margin term in the loss, as we observe\\ndiminishing improvements after data scaling. Following Llama 2, we use all of our preference data for reward\\nmodeling after filtering out samples with similar responses. In addition to standard preference pair of (chosen,\\nrejected) response, annotations also create a third “edited response” for some prompts, where the chosen\\nresponse from the pair is further edited for improvement (see Section 4.2.1). Hence, each preference ranking\\nsample has two or three responses with clear ranking (edited > chosen > rejected). We concatenate the\\nprompt and multiple responses into a single row during training with responses randomly shuffled. This is an\\napproximation to the standard scenario of putting the responses in separate rows and computing the scores,\\nbut in our ablations, this approach improves training efficiency without a loss in accuracy.\\n4.1.3 Supervised Finetuning\\nThe reward model is then used to perform rejection sampling on our human annotation prompts, the details\\nof which are described in Section 4.2. Together with this rejection-sampled data and other data sources\\n(including synthetic data), we finetune the pre-trained language model using a standard cross entropy loss\\non the target tokens (while masking loss on prompt tokens). More details about the data mix can be found\\nin Section 4.2. We refer to this stage assupervised finetuning(SFT; Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022;\\nWang et al., 2022b), even though many of the training targets are model-generated. Our largest models are\\nfinetuned with a learning rate of10−5 over the course of 8.5K to 9K steps. We found these hyperparameter\\nsettings to work well across different rounds and data mixes.\\n4.1.4 Direct Preference Optimization\\nWe further train our SFT models with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2024) for human\\npreference alignment. For training, we primarily use the most recent batches of preference data collected using\\nthe best performing models from the previous alignment rounds. As a result, our training data conforms better\\nto the distribution of the policy model that is being optimized in each round. We also explored on-policy\\nalgorithms such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), but found that DPO required less compute for large-scale\\nmodels and performed better, especially on instruction following benchmarks like IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023).\\nFor Llama 3, we use a learning rate of10−5 and set theβ hyper-parameter to be 0.1. In addition, we apply\\nthe following algorithmic modifications to DPO:\\n• Masking out formatting tokens in DPO loss : We mask out special formatting tokens including header\\nand termination tokens (described in Section 4.1.1) from both chosen and rejected responses in the\\nloss to stabilize DPO training. We observe that having these tokens contribute to the loss may lead\\nto undesired model behaviors such as tail repetition or abruptly generating termination tokens. We\\nhypothesize that this is due to the contrastive nature of the DPO loss – the presence of common tokens\\nin both chosen and rejected responses leads to a conflicting learning objective as the model needs to\\nincrease and reduce the likelihood of these tokens simultaneously.\\n• Regularization with NLL loss: We add an additional negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss term with a scaling\\ncoefficient of0.2 on the chosen sequences, similar to Pang et al. (2024). This helps further stabilize DPO\\ntraining by maintaining desired formatting for generation and preventing the decrease of log probability\\nof chosen responses (Pang et al., 2024; Pal et al., 2024).\\n4.1.5 Model Averaging\\nFinally, we average models obtained from experiments using various versions of data or hyperparameters at\\neach RM, SFT, or DPO stage (Izmailov et al., 2019; Wortsman et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022).\\n16'),\n",

In each cycle, we collect new preference\\nannotations and SFT data, sampling synthetic data from the latest models.\\n4.2 Post-training Data\\nThe post-training data composition plays a critical role in the usefulness and behavior of language models. In\\nthis section, we discuss our human annotation procedures and preference data collection (Section 4.2.1), the\\ncomposition of our SFT data (Section 4.2.2), and methods for data quality control and cleaning (Section 4.2.3).\\n4.2.1 Preference Data\\nOur preference data annotation process is similar to Llama 2. We deploy multiple models for annotation after\\neach round and sample two responses from two different models for each user prompt. These models can\\nbe trained with different data mixes and alignment recipes, allowing for different capability strength (e.g.,\\ncode expertise) and increased data diversity. We ask annotators to rate the strength of their preference by\\ncategorizing it into one of four levels, based on how much more they prefer the chosen response over the\\nrejected one: significantly better, better, slightly better, or marginally better. We also incorporate an editing\\nstep after preference ranking to encourage annotators to further improve the preferred response. Annotators\\nedit the chosen response directly or prompt the model with feedback to refine its own response. Consequently,\\na portion of our preference data has three responses ranked (edited > chosen > rejected).\\nIn Table 6, we report the statistics of preference annotations that we use for Llama 3 training. General English\\ncovers multiple subcategories such as knowledge-based question and answering or precise instruction-following,\\nwhich fall outside the scope of specific capabilities. Compared to Llama 2, we observe an increase in the\\naverage length of prompt and response, suggesting that we train Llama 3 on more complex tasks. In addition,\\nwe implement a quality analysis and human evaluation process to rigorously assess the data collected, allowing\\nus to refine our prompts and provide systematic, actionable feedback to annotators. For example, as Llama 3\\nimproves after each round, we increase prompt complexity accordingly to target areas where the model lags.\\nIn each round of post-training, we use all the preference data that is available at the time for reward modeling,\\nwhile only using the latest batches from various capabilities for DPO training. For both reward modeling and\\nDPO, we use samples that are labeled as the chosen response being significantly better or better than the\\nrejected counterpart for training and discard samples with similar responses.\\n4.2.2 SFT Data\\nOur finetuning data is largely comprised of the following sources:\\n• Prompts from our human annotation collection with rejection-sampled responses.\\n• Synthetic data targeting specific capabilities (see Section 4.3 for more details).\\n17'),\n",

In this section, we discuss the details for the\\nrejection-sampling procedure and overall composition of our final SFT datamix.\\nRejection sampling. During rejection sampling (RS), for each prompt collected during human annotation\\n(Section 4.2.1) we sampleK (typically between 10 and 30) outputs from the latest chat model policy (usually\\nthe best performing checkpoint from the previous post-training iteration, or the best performing checkpoint\\nfor a particular capability) and use our reward model to select the best candidate, consistent with Bai et al.\\n(2022). In later rounds of post-training, we introduce system prompts to steer RS responses to conform with\\ndesirable tone, style, or formatting, which might be different for different capabilities.\\nTo increase the efficiency of rejection sampling, we adopt PagedAttention (Kwon et al., 2023). PagedAttention\\nenhances memory efficiency through dynamic key-value cache allocation. It supports arbitrary output lengths\\nby dynamically scheduling requests based on the current cache capacity. Unfortunately, this carries the risk of\\nswap-out when running out of memory. To eliminate such swap overhead, we define a maximum output length\\nand perform a request only if sufficient memory is available to fit an output with that length. PagedAttention\\nalso enables us to share the key-value cache pages for a prompt across all corresponding outputs. Together,\\nthis leads to a throughput improvement of over2× during rejection sampling.\\nOverall data composition. Table 7 shows data statistics for each broad category of our “helpfulness” mix. While\\nSFT and preference data contain overlapping domains, they are curated differently, yielding distinct count\\nstatistics. In Section 4.2.3 we describe techniques for categorizing topic, complexity, and quality of our data\\nsamples. In each round of post-training, we adjust our overall data mix carefully across these axes to tune\\nperformance across a wide range of benchmarks. Our final data mix epochs multiple times on some high\\nquality sources and downsamples others.\\n4.2.3 Data Processing and Quality Control\\nGiven that most of our training data ismodel-generated, it requires careful cleaning and quality control.\\nData cleaning. In the early rounds, we observed a number of undesirable patterns common in our data, such\\nas excessive use of emojis or exclamation points. Therefore, we implement a series of rule-based data removal\\nand modification strategies to filter or clean problematic data. For example, to mitigate overly-apologetic\\ntonal issues, we identify overused phrases (such as “I’m sorry” or “I apologize”) and carefully balance the\\nproportion of such samples in our dataset.\\nData pruning. We also apply a collection of model-based techniques to remove low-quality training samples\\nand improve overall model performance:\\n• Topic classification: We first finetune Llama 3 8B into a topic classifier, and perform inference over\\nall data to classify it into both coarsely-grained buckets (“mathematical reasoning”) and fine-grained\\n18'),\n",

We also prompt Llama 3 to measure the difficulty (Liu et al., 2024c)\\nof dialogs on a three-point scale.\\n• Semantic deduplication: Finally, we perform semantic deduplication (Abbas et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\\n2024c). We first cluster complete dialogs using RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b) and within each cluster\\nsort them by quality score× difficulty score. We then do greedy selection by iterating through all sorted\\nexamples, and only keeping the ones that have maximum cosine similarity less than a threshold to the\\nexamples seen so far in the cluster.\\n4.3 Capabilities\\nWe highlight special efforts to improve performance for specific capabilities such as code (Section 4.3.1),\\nmultilinguality (Section 4.3.2), math and reasoning (Section 4.3.3), long context (Section 4.3.4), tool use\\n(Section 4.3.5), factuality (Section 4.3.6), and steerability (Section 4.3.7).\\n4.3.1 Code\\nLLMs for code have received significant attention since the release of Copilot and Codex (Chen et al., 2021).\\nDevelopers are now widely using these models to generate code snippets, debug, automate tasks, and improve\\ncode quality. For Llama 3, we target improving and evaluating code generation, documentation, debugging,\\nand review capabilities for the following high priority programming languages: Python, Java, Javascript,\\nC/C++, Typescript, Rust, PHP, HTML/CSS, SQL, bash/shell. Here, we present our work on improving\\nthese coding capabilities via training a code expert, generating synthetic data for SFT, improving formatting\\nwith system prompt steering, and creating quality filters to remove bad samples from our training data.\\nExpert training. We train acode expert which we use to collect high quality human annotations for code\\nthroughout subsequent rounds of post-training. This is accomplished by branching the main pre-training run\\nand continuing pre-training on a 1T token mix of mostly (>85%) code data. Continued pre-training on domain-\\nspecific data has been shown to be effective for improving performance in a specific domain (Gururangan\\net al., 2020). We follow a recipe similar to that of CodeLlama (Rozière et al., 2023). For the last several\\nthousand steps of training we perform long-context finetuning (LCFT) to extend the expert’s context length\\nto 16K tokens on a high quality mix of repo-level code data. Finally, we follow the similar post-training\\nmodeling recipes described in Section 4.1 to align this model, except with SFT and DPO data mixes primarily\\ntargeting code. This model is also used for rejection sampling (Section 4.2.2) for coding prompts.\\nSynthetic data generation. During development, we identified key issues in code generation, including difficulty\\nin following instructions, code syntax errors, incorrect code generation, and difficulty in fixing bugs. While\\nintensive human annotation could theoretically resolve these issues, synthetic data generation offers a\\ncomplementary approach at a lower cost and higher scale, unconstrained by the expertise level of annotators.\\nAs such, we use Llama 3 and the code expert to generate a large quantity of synthetic SFT dialogs.\\nWe describe three high-level approaches for generating synthetic code data. In total, we generate over2.7M\\nsynthetic examples which were used during SFT.\\n19'),\n",

Synthetic data generation: execution feedback. The 8B and 70B models show significant performance\\nimprovements when trained on data generated by a larger, more competent model. However, our initial\\nexperiments revealed that training Llama 3 405B on its own generated data is not helpful (and can\\neven degrade performance). To address this limitation, we introduced execution feedback as a source of\\ntruth, enabling the model to learn from its mistakes and stay on track. In particular, we generate large\\ndataset of approximately one million synthetic coding dialogues using the following process:\\n• Problem description generation: First, we generate a large collection of programming problem\\ndescriptions that span a diverse range of topics, including those in the long tail distribution. To\\nachieve this diversity, we sample random code snippets from various sources and prompt the model\\nto generate programming problems inspired by these examples. This allowed us to tap into a wide\\nrange of topics and create a comprehensive set of problem descriptions (Wei et al., 2024).\\n• Solution generation: Then, we prompt Llama 3 to solve each problem in a given programming\\nlanguage. We observe that adding general rules of good programming to the prompt improves the\\ngenerated solution quality. Also, we find it is helpful to require the model to explain its thought\\nprocess in comments.\\n• Correctness analysis: After generating a solution, it is crucial to recognize that its correctness is\\nnot guaranteed, and including incorrect solutions in the finetuning dataset could harm the model’s\\nquality. While we do not ensure complete correctness, we develop methods to approximate it. To\\nachieve this, we extract the source code from the generated solution and applied a combination of\\nstatic and dynamic analysis techniques to test its correctness, including:\\n– Static analysis: We run all generated code through a parser and a linter to ensure syntactic\\ncorrectness, catching errors such as syntax errors, use of uninitialized variables or non-imported\\nfunctions, code style issues, typing errors, and others.\\n– Unit test generation and execution : For each problem and solution, we prompt the model\\nto generate unit tests, executed in a containerized environment together with the solution,\\ncatching run-time execution errors and some semantic errors.\\n• Error feedback and iterative self-correction: When a solution fails at any step, we prompt the\\nmodel to revise it. The prompt included the original problem description, the faulty solution,\\nand feedback from the parser/linter/tester (stdout, stderr/ and return code). After a unit test\\nexecution failure, the model could either fix the code to pass the existing tests or modify its unit\\ntests to accommodate the generated code. Only dialogs that pass all checks are included in the final\\ndataset, used for supervised finetuning (SFT). Notably, we observed that about 20% of solutions\\nwere initially incorrect but self-corrected, indicating that the model learned from the execution\\nfeedback and improved its performance.\\n• Fine-tuning and iterative improvement: The finetuning process is conducted over multiple rounds,\\nwith each round building on the previous one. After each round, the model is improved, generating\\nhigher-quality synthetic data for the next round. This iterative process allows for progressive\\nrefinement and enhancement of the model’s performance.\\n2. Synthetic data generation: programming language translation. We observe a performance gap between\\nmajor programming languages (e.g., Python/C++) and less common ones (e.g., Typescript/PHP). This\\nis not surprising as we have less training data for less common programming languages. To mitigate\\nthis, we supplement our existing data bytranslating data from common programming languages to\\nless common languages (similar to Chen et al. (2023) in the context of reasoning). This is achieved\\nby prompting Llama 3 and ensuring quality via syntax parsing, compilation, and execution. Figure 8\\ndemonstrates an example of synthetic PHP code translated from Python. This improves performance\\nsignificantly for less common languages as measured by the MultiPL-E (Cassano et al., 2023) benchmark.\\n3. Synthetic data generation: backtranslation. To improve certain coding capabilities (e.g., documentation,\\nexplanations) where execution feedback is less informative for determining quality, we employ an\\nalternative multi-step approach. Using this procedure, we generated approximately 1.2M synthetic\\n20'),\n",

To address this, we utilize the “model-as-judge” approach,\\nwhere earlier versions of Llama 3 assess and assign a binary (0/1) score based on two criteria: code correctness\\nand code style. We retain only those samples that achieve a perfect score of 2. Initially, this stringent filtering\\nled to a regression in downstream benchmark performance, primarily because it disproportionately removed\\nexamples with challenging prompts. To counteract this, we strategically revise the responses of some coding\\ndata categorized as most challenging until they met the Llama-based “model-as-judge” criteria.

Our Llama 3 pre-training data mix contains significantly more English tokens than non-English\\ntokens. To collect higher quality human annotations in non-English languages, we train amultilingual expert by\\nbranching off the pre-training run and continuing to pre-train on a data mix that consists of90% multilingual\\ntokens. We then perform post-training on this expert following Section 4.1. This expert model is then used to\\ncollect higher quality annotations in non-English languages until pre-training was fully complete.\\nMultilingual data collection. Our multilingual SFT data is derived primarily from sources described below. The\\noverall distribution is 2.4% human annotations, 44.2% data from other NLP tasks, 18.8% rejection sampled\\ndata, and 34.6% translated reasoning data.\\n• Human annotations: We collect high-quality, manually annotated data from linguists and native speakers.\\nThese annotations mostly consist of open-ended prompts that represent real world use cases.\\n• Data from other NLP tasks : To further augment, we use multilingual training data from other tasks\\nand rewrite into dialog format. For example, we use data from exams-qa (Hardalov et al., 2020)\\nand Conic10k (Wu et al., 2023). To improve language alignment, we also use parallel texts from\\nGlobalVoices (Prokopidis et al., 2016) and Wikimedia (Tiedemann, 2012). We use LID based filtering\\nand Blaser2.0 (Seamless Communication et al., 2023) to remove low quality data. For parallel text data,\\ninstead of using the bitext pairs directly, we apply a multilingual template inspired by Wei et al. (2022a)\\nto better simulate real-life conversations in translation and language learning scenarios.\\n• Rejection sampled data : We apply rejection sampling on our human annotated prompts to generate\\nhigh-quality samples for finetuning, with few modifications compared to the process for English data:\\n– Generation: We explored randomly choosing the temperature hyperparameter from the range\\n0.2 − 1 for diverse generations in early rounds of post-training. With high temperature, responses\\nfor multilingual prompts can get creative and inspiring, but are also susceptible to unnecessary\\nor unnatural code-switching. In the final round of post-training, we use a constant value of 0.6\\nto balance the trade-off. Additionally, we used specialized system prompts to improve response\\nformat, structure and general readability.\\n– Selection: Prior to reward model based selection, we implement multilingual-specific checks to\\nensure high language-match rate between the prompt and response (e.g., a romanized Hindi prompt\\nshould not expect a response in Hindi Devanagari script).\\n• Translated data: We try to avoid using machine-translated data to finetune the model in order to\\nprevent translationese (Bizzoni et al., 2020; Muennighoff et al., 2023) or possible name bias (Wang\\net al., 2022a), gender bias (Savoldi et al., 2021), or cultural bias (Ji et al., 2023). Moreover, we aim to\\nprevent the model from being exposed only to tasks that are rooted in English cultural context, which\\nmay not be representative of the linguistic and cultural diversity we aim to capture. We made one\\nexception to this and translated our synthetic quantitative reasoning data (see Section 4.3.3 for details)\\nto improve performance in quantitative reasoning in non-English languages.

We observed strong gains on MGSM (Shi et al., 2022) from adding this translated data.\\n4.3.3 Math and Reasoning\\nWe define reasoning as the ability to perform multi-step computations and arrive at the correct final answer.\\nSeveral challenges guide our approach to training models that excel in mathematical reasoning:\\n• Lack of prompts: As the complexity of questions increases, the number of valid prompts or questions\\nfor Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) decreases. This scarcity makes it difficult to create diverse and\\nrepresentative training datasets for teaching models various mathematical skills (Yu et al., 2023; Yue\\net al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2024; Shao et al., 2024; Yue et al., 2024b).\\n• Lack of ground truth chain of thought : Effective reasoning requires a step-by-step solution to facilitate\\nthe reasoning process (Wei et al., 2022c). However, there is often a shortage of ground truth chains of\\nthought, which are essential for guiding the model how to break down the problem step-by-step and\\nreach the final answer (Zelikman et al., 2022).\\n• Incorrect intermediate steps : When using model-generated chains of thought, the intermediate steps\\nmay not always be correct (Cobbe et al., 2021; Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al.,\\n2023a). This inaccuracy can lead to incorrect final answers and needs to be addressed.\\n• Teaching models to use external tools: Enhancing models to utilize external tools, such as code interpreters,\\nallows them to reason by interleaving code and text (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022; Gou et al.,\\n2023). This capability can significantly improve their problem-solving abilities.\\n• Discrepancy between training and inference : There is often a discrepancy between how the model is\\nfinetuned during training and how it is used during inference. During inference, the finetuned model may\\ninteract with humans or other models, requiring it to improve its reasoning using feedback. Ensuring\\nconsistency between training and real-world usage is crucial for maintaining reasoning performance.\\nTo address these challenges, we apply the following methodologies:\\n• Addressing the lack of prompts: We source relevant pre-training data from mathematical contexts and\\nconverted it into a question-answer format which can then be used for supervised finetuning. Additionally,\\nwe identify mathematical skills where the model under-performs and actively sourced prompts from\\nhumans to teach models such skills. To facilitate this process, we create a taxonomy of mathematical\\nskills (Didolkar et al., 2024) and ask humans to provide relevant prompts/questions accordingly.\\n• Augmenting training data with step-wise reasoning traces : We use Llama 3 to generate step-by-step\\nsolutions for a set of prompts. For each prompt, the model produces a variable number of generations.\\nThese generations are then filtered based on the correct answer (Li et al., 2024a). We also do self-\\nverification where Llama 3 is used to verify whether a particular step-by-step solution is valid for a given\\nquestion. This process improves the quality of the finetuning data by eliminating instances where the\\nmodel does not produce valid reasoning traces.\\n• Filtering incorrect reasoning traces: We train outcome and stepwise reward models (Lightman et al., 2023;\\nWang et al., 2023a) to filter training data where the intermediate reasoning steps were incorrect. These\\nreward models are used to eliminate data with invalid step-by-step reasoning, ensuring high-quality\\ndata for finetuning. For more challenging prompts, we use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with\\nlearned step-wise reward models to generate valid reasoning traces, further enhancing the collection of\\nhigh-quality reasoning data (Xie et al., 2024).\\n• Interleaving code and text reasoning : We prompt Llama 3 to solve reasoning problems through a\\ncombination of textual reasoning and associated Python code (Gou et al., 2023). Code execution is used\\nas a feedback signal to eliminate cases where the reasoning chain was not valid, ensuring the correctness\\nof the reasoning process.\\n• Learning from feedback and mistakes : To simulate human feedback, we utilize incorrect generations (i.e.,\\ngenerations leading to incorrect reasoning traces) and perform error correction by prompting Llama 3 to\\n23'),\n",

Similar to pre-training, we find that during finetuning we must carefully\\ntune the recipe to balance short and long-context capabilities.\\nSFT and synthetic data generation. Naively applying our existing SFT recipe with only short-context data\\nresulted in significant regressions in long-context capabilities from pre-training, highlighting the need to\\nincorporate long-context data in our SFT data mix. In practice, however, it is largely impractical to get humans\\nto annotate such examples due to the tedious and time-consuming nature of reading lengthy contexts, so we\\npredominantly rely on synthetic data to fill this gap. We use earlier versions of Llama 3 to generate synthetic\\ndata based on the key long-context use-cases: (possibly multi-turn) question-answering, summarization for\\nlong documents, and reasoning over code repositories, and describe them in greater detail below.\\n• Question answering: We carefully curate a set of long documents from our pre-training mix. We split\\nthese documents into chunks of 8K tokens, and prompted an earlier version of the Llama 3 model to\\ngenerate QA pairs conditional on randomly selected chunks. During training, the whole document is\\nused as context.\\n• Summarization: We applied hierarchical summarization of long-context documents by first summarizing\\nthe chunks of 8K input length using our strongest Llama 3 8K context model and then summarizing\\nthe summaries. During training we provide the full document and prompt the model to summarize the\\ndocument while preserving all the important details. We also generate QA pairs based on the summaries\\nof the documents and prompt the model with questions that require global understanding of the whole\\nlong document.\\n• Long context code reasoning: We parse Python files to identifyimport statements and determine their\\ndependencies. From here, we select the most commonly depended-upon files, specifically those referenced\\nby at least five other files. We remove one of these key files from a repository and prompt the model to\\nidentify which files depended on the missing file and to generate the necessary missing code.\\nWe further categorize these synthetically generated samples based on the sequence length (16K, 32K, 64K\\nand 128K) to enable more fine-grained targeting of input lengths.\\nThrough careful ablations, we observe that mixing0.1% of synthetically generated long-context data with the\\noriginal short-context data optimizes the performance across both short-context and long-context benchmarks.\\nDPO. We observe that using only short context training data in DPO did not negatively impact long-context\\nperformance as long as the SFT model is high quality in long context tasks. We suspect this is due to the\\nfact that our DPO recipe has fewer optimizer steps than SFT. Given this finding, we keep the standard\\nshort-context recipe for DPO on top of our long-context SFT checkpoints.\\n4.3.5 Tool Use\\nTeaching LLMs to use tools such as search engines or code interpreters hugely expands the range of tasks\\nthey can solve, transforming them from pure chat models into more general assistants (Nakano et al., 2021;\\nThoppilan et al., 2022; Parisi et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023; Mialon et al., 2023a; Schick et al., 2024). We train\\nLlama 3 to interact with the following tools:\\n• Search engine. Llama 3 is trained to use Brave Search7 to answer questions about recent events that go\\nbeyond its knowledge cutoff or that require retrieving a particular piece of information from the web.\\n• Python interpreter.

Llama 3 can use the Wolfram Alpha API8 to more accurately solve\\nmath, science problems, or retrieve accurate information from Wolfram’s database.\\nThe resulting model is able to use these tools in a chat setup to solve the user’s queries, including in multi-turn\\ndialogs. If a query requires multiple tool calls, the model can write a step-by-step plan, call the tools in\\nsequence, and do reasoning after each tool call.\\nWe also improve Llama 3’s zero-shot tool use capabilities — given in-context, potentially unseen tool definitions\\nand a user query, we train the model to generate the correct tool call.\\nImplementation. We implement our core tools as Python objects with different methods. Zero-shot tools can\\nbe implemented as Python functions with descriptions, documentation (i.e., examples for how to use them),\\nand the model only needs the function’s signature and docstring as context to generate the appropriate call.\\nWe also convert function definitions and calls to JSON format, e.g., for web API calls. All tool calls are\\nexecuted by the Python interpreter, that must be enabled in the Llama 3 system prompt. Core tools can be\\nindividually enabled or disabled in the system prompt.\\nData collection. Different from Schick et al. (2024), we rely on human annotations and preferences to teach\\nLlama 3 to use tools. There are two main differences with the post-training pipeline generally used in Llama 3:\\n• For tools, dialogs often contain more than a single assistant message (e.g., calling the tool and reasoning\\nabout the tool output). Thus, we annotate at the message level to collect granular feedback: annotators\\nprovide a preference between two assistant messages with the same context or, if both contain major\\nproblems, edit one of the messages. The chosen or edited message is then added to the context and the\\ndialog continues. This provides human feedback for both the assistant’s ability of calling the tools and\\nreasoning about the tool outputs. Annotators cannot rank or edit the tool outputs.\\n• We do not perform rejection sampling, as we did not observe gains in our tool benchmarks.\\nTo accelerate the annotation process, we start by bootstrapping basic tool use capabilities by finetuning on\\nsynthetically generated data from previous Llama 3 checkpoints. Thus, annotators have fewer edits to perform.\\nIn a similar spirit, as Llama 3 gradually improves through its development, we progressively complexify our\\nhuman annotation protocols: we start by single-turn tool use annotations, before moving to tool use in dialogs,\\nand finally annotating for multi-step tool use and data analysis.\\nTool datasets. To create data for tool usage applications, we leverage the following procedure:\\n• Single-step tool use: We start by few-shot generation of synthetic user prompts which, by construction,\\nrequire a call to one of our core tools (for example, questions that exceed our knowledge cutoff date).\\nThen, still relying on few-shot generation, we generate appropriate tool calls for these prompts, execute\\nthem, and add the output to the model’s context. Finally, we prompt the model again to generate a\\nfinal answer to the user’s query based on the tool output. We end up with trajectories of the following\\nform: system prompt, user prompt, tool call, tool output, final answer. We also filter around30% this\\ndataset to remove tool calls that cannot be executed or other formatting issues.\\n• Multi-step tool use: We follow a similar protocol and first generate synthetic data to teach the model\\nbasic multi-step tool use capabilities. To do this, we first prompt Llama 3 to generate user prompts\\nthat require at least two tool calls, that can be the same or different tools from our core set. Then,\\nconditioned on these prompts, we few-shot prompt Llama 3 to generate a solution consisting of interleaved\\nreasoning steps and tool calls, similar to ReAct (Yao et al., 2022).

We augment our synthetic data with different system prompts to teach the model to use\\ntools only when activated. To train the model to avoid calling tools for simple queries, we also add queries\\nfrom easy math or question answering datasets (Berant et al., 2013; Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016; Joshi\\net al., 2017; Amini et al., 2019) and their responses without tools, but with tools activated in system prompt.\\nZero-shot tool use data. We improve Llama 3 zero-shot tool use abilities (also referred to as function calling)\\nby finetuning on a large and diverse set of partly synthetic (functions definitions, user query, corresponding\\ncall) tuples. We evaluate our model on a set of unseen tools.\\n• Single, nested, and parallel function calling: Calls can be simple, nested,i.e. we pass a function call as an\\nargument of another function, or parallel,i.e. the model returns a list of independent function calls.\\nGenerating a diverse set of functions, queries and ground truths can be challenging (Mekala et al., 2024),\\nand we resort to mining the Stack (Kocetkov et al., 2022) to ground our synthetic user queries in real\\nfunctions. More precisely, we extract function calls and their definitions, clean and filter them,e.g. for\\nmissing docstrings or non-executable functions, and use Llama 3 to generate a natural language query\\ncorresponding to the function call.\\n• Multi-turn function calling: We also generate synthetic data for multi-turn dialogs with function calls,\\nfollowing a protocol similar to the one proposed in Li et al. (2023b). We use multiple agents that\\ngenerate domains, APIs, user queries, API calls, and responses, while also ensuring that the generated\\ndata covers a set of diverse domains and realistic APIs. All agents are variants of Llama 3 prompted in\\ndifferent ways depending on their roles and collaborate in a step-by-step manner.\\n4.3.6 Factuality\\nHallucinations remain a major challenge for large language models. Models tend to be overconfident, even in\\ndomains where they have little knowledge. Despite these shortcomings, they are often used as knowledge bases,\\nwhich can lead to risky outcomes such as the spread of misinformation. While we recognize that factuality\\ncan go beyond hallucinations, we took a hallucination-first approach here.\\n26'),\n",

Example of Llama 3 performing analysis and visualization of an uploaded file.\\nWe follow the principle that post-training should align the model to “know what it knows” rather than add\\nknowledge (Gekhman et al., 2024; Mielke et al., 2020). Our primary approach involves generating data that\\naligns model generations with subsets of factual data present in the pre-training data. To achieve this, we\\ndevelop a knowledge probing technique that takes advantage of Llama 3’s in-context abilities. This data\\ngeneration process involves the following procedure:\\n1. Extract a data snippet from the pre-training data.\\n2. Generate a factual question about these snippets (context) by prompting Llama 3.\\n3. Sample responses from Llama 3 to the question.\\n4.

For Llama 3, we focus on enhancing its steerability through system prompt with natural language\\ninstructions, especially around response length, format, tone and character/persona.\\nData collection. We collect steerability preference samples within the general English category by asking\\nannotators to design different system prompts for Llama 3. Annotators then engage in conversations with the\\nmodels to evaluate their consistency in following instructions defined in system prompts over the course of the\\nconversation. We show an example customized system prompt used for enhancing steerability below:\\nYou are a helpful and cheerful AI Chatbot that acts as a meal plan assistant for busy families.\\nThe family consists of 2 adults, 3 teenagers, and 2 preschoolers. Plan two or three days at a time\\nand use leftovers or extra ingredients for the second day’s plan. The user will let you know if they\\nwant two or three days. If they don’t, assume three days. Each plan should include breakfast,\\nlunch, snack, and dinner. Ask the user if they approve of the plan or need adjustments. After they\\napprove provide a grocery list with family size in mind. Always keep family preferences in mind\\nand if there’s something that they don’t like provide a substitution. If the user is not feeling\\ninspired then ask them what’s the one place they wish they could visit on vacation this week\\nand then suggest meals based on that location’s culture. Weekend meals can be more complex.\\nWeekday meals should be quick and easy. For breakfast and lunch, easy food like cereal, English\\nmuffins with pre-cooked bacon, and other quick easy foods are preferred. The family is busy. Be\\nsure to ask if they have essentials and favorites on hand like coffee or energy drinks so they don’t\\nforget to buy it. Remember to be budget-conscious unless it’s a special occasion.\\nModeling. After we collect the preference data, we leverage this data in reward modeling, rejection sampling,\\nSFT, and DPO to enhance Llama 3’s steerability.\\n5 Results\\nWe performed an extensive series of evaluations of Llama 3, investigating the performance of:(1) the pre-trained\\nlanguage model,(2) the post-trained language model, and(3) the safety characteristics of Llama 3. We present\\nthe results of these evaluations in separate subsections below.\\n5.1 Pre-trained Language Model\\nIn this section, we report evaluation results for our pre-trained Llama 3 (Section 3), comparing with various\\nother models of comparable sizes. We reproduce results of competitor models whenever possible. For non-\\nLlama models, we report the best score across results that are publicly reported or (where possible) that we\\nreproduced ourselves. The specifics of these evaluations, including configurations such as the number of shots,\\nmetrics, and other pertinent hyperparameters and settings, can be accessed on our Github repository here.\\nAdditionally, we are releasing the data generated as part of evaluations with publicly available benchmarks\\nwhich can be found on Huggingface here. We evaluate the quality of our models on standard benchmarks\\n(Section 5.1.1), for robustness to changes in multiple-choice question setups (Section 5.1.2), and on adversarial\\nevaluations (Section 5.1.3). We also conduct a contamination analysis to estimate the extent to which our\\nevaluations are impacted by contamination of training data (Section 5.1.4).\\n5.1.1 Standard Benchmarks\\nTo compare our models with the current state-of-the-art, we evaluate Llama 3 on a large number of standard\\nbenchmark evaluations shown in Table 8. These evaluations cover eight top-level categories:(1) commonsense\\nreasoning; (2) knowledge; (3) reading comprehension; (4) math, reasoning, and problem solving;(5) long\\ncontext; (6) code; (7) adversarial evaluations; and(8) aggregate evaluations.\\n28'),\n",

For each benchmark, we compute scores for Llama 3 as well as various other pre-trained\\nmodels of comparable sizes. Where possible, we recompute numbers with our own pipeline for other models.\\nTo ensure a fair comparison, we then select the best score between the score that we computed and the\\nreported number for that model with comparable or more conservative settings. You can find additional\\ndetails on our evaluation setup here. For some models, it is not possible to (re)compute benchmark values,\\nfor instance, because the pre-trained model is not released or because the API does not provide access to\\nlog-probabilities. In particular, this is true for all models comparable to Llama 3 405B. Thus, we do not\\nreport category averages for Llama 3 405B, which requires that all numbers are available for all benchmarks.\\nSignificance estimates. Benchmark scores are estimates of a model’s true performance. These estimates\\nhave variance because benchmark sets are finite samples drawn from some underlying distribution. We\\nfollow Madaan et al. (2024b) and report on this variance via 95% confidence intervals (CIs), assuming that\\nbenchmark scores are Gaussian distributed. While this assumption is incorrect (e.g., benchmark scores are\\nbounded), preliminary bootstrap experiments suggest CIs (for discrete metrics) are a good approximation:\\nCI (S) = 1.96 ×\\nr\\nS × (1 − S)\\nN .\\nHerein, S is the observed benchmark score (e.g., accuracy or EM) andN the sample size of the benchmark.\\nWe omit CIs for benchmark scores that are not simple averages. We note that because subsampling is not the\\nonly source of variation, our CI values lower bound the actual variation in the capability estimate.\\nResults for 8B and 70B models. Figure 12 reports the average performance of Llama 3 8B and 70B on the\\ncommonsense reasoning, knowledge, reading comprehension, math and reasoning, and code benchmarks. The\\nresults show that Llama 3 8B outperforms competing models in virtually every category, both in terms of\\nper-category win rate and in terms of average per-category performance. We also find that Llama 3 70B\\noutperforms its predecessor Llama 2 70B by a large margin on most benchmarks, with the exception of\\ncommonsense benchmarks that are likely saturated. Llama 3 70B also outperforms Mixtral 8x22B.\\nDetailed results for all models.

Figure 14 presents the results of our study of robustness to answer\\norder and prompt format. The results in the figure further underscore the robustness of the performance of\\nour pre-trained language models, in particular, of Llama 3 405B.\\n5.1.3 Adversarial Benchmarks\\nIn addition to the benchmarks presented above, we evaluate on several adversarial benchmarks in three areas:\\nquestion answering, mathematical reasoning, and paraphrase detection. This testing probes the model’s\\ncapabilities on tasks specifically created to be challenging and can potentially also point to overfitting on\\nbenchmarks. For question answering, we use Adversarial SQuAD (Jia and Liang, 2017) and Dynabench\\nSQuAD (Kiela et al., 2021). For mathematical reasoning, we use GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024c). For paraphrase\\ndetection, we use PAWS (Zhang et al., 2019).\\nFigure 15 presents the scores of Llama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B on the adversarial benchmarks as a function of their\\nperformance on non-adversarial benchmarks. The non-adversarial benchmarks we use are SQuAD (Rajpurkar\\net al., 2016) for question answering, GSM8K for mathematical reasoning, and QQP (Wang et al., 2017) for\\nparaphrase detection. Each datapoint represents a pair of an adversarial and non-adversarial datasets (e.g.\\nQQP paired with PAWS), and we show all possible pairs within a category. The diagonal black line represents\\nparity between adversarial and non-adversarial datasets — being on the line would indicate the model has\\nsimilar performance regardless of the adversarial nature.\\nOn paraphrase detection, neither pre-trained nor post-trained models appear to suffer from the type of\\nadversariality with which PAWS was constructed, marking a substantial step with respect to the previous\\ngeneration of models. This result confirms the findings of Weber et al. (2023a), who also found that LLMs are\\nless susceptible to the type of spurious correlations found in several adversarial datasets. For mathematical\\nreasoning and question answering, however, the adversarial performances are substantially lower than the\\nnon-adversarial performances. This pattern is similar for pre-trained and post-trained models.\\n5.1.4 Contamination Analysis\\nWe conduct a contamination analysis to estimate to what extent benchmark scores may be influenced\\nby contamination of the evaluation data in the pre-training corpus. In previous work, several different\\ncontamination methods have been used, with various different hyperparameters – we refer to Singh et al.\\n(2024) for an overview. Any of these methods can suffer from false positives and negatives, and how to best\\nrun contamination analyses is currently still an open field of research. Here, we largely follow the suggestions\\nof Singh et al. (2024).\\n33'),\n",

(2024) propose to\\nselect contamination detection methods empirically,\\nbased on which method results in the largest dif-\\nference between the ‘clean’ part of the dataset and\\nthe entire dataset, which they callestimated per-\\nformance gain. For all our evaluation datasets, we\\nscore examples based on 8-gram overlap, a method\\nthat was found by Singh et al. (2024) to be accurate\\nfor many datasets. We consider an example of a\\ndataset D to be contaminated if a ratioTD of its\\ntokens are part of an 8-gram occurring at least once\\nin the pre-training corpus. We selectTD separately\\nfor each dataset, based on which value shows the\\nmaximal significant estimated performance gain\\nacross the three model sizes.\\nResults. In Table 15, we report the percentage of\\nevaluation data that is considered contaminated\\nfor the maximal estimated performance gain, as\\ndescribed above, for all key benchmarks. From\\nthe table, we exclude numbers for benchmarks for\\nwhich the results are not significant, for instance\\nbecause the clean or contaminated set has too few\\nexamples, or because the observed performance\\ngain estimate shows extremely erratic behavior. In\\nTable 15, we observe that for some datasets con-\\ntamination has a large impact, while for others it\\ndoes not. For example, for PiQA and HellaSwag,\\nboth the estimation of contamination and the esti-\\nmation of performance gain are high. For Natural\\nQuestions, on the other hand, the estimated 52%\\ncontamination seems to have virtually no effect\\non the performance. For SQuAD and MATH, low\\nthresholds yield high levels of contamination, but\\nno performance gains. This suggests that contam-\\nination is either not helpful for these datasets, or\\nthat a larger n is required to obtain a better es-\\ntimate. Finally, for MBPP, HumanEval, MMLU\\nand MMLU-Pro, other contamination detection methods may be needed: even with higher thresholds, 8-gram\\noverlap gives such high contamination scores that it is impossible to get a good performance gain estimate.\\n5.2 Post-trained Language Model\\nWe present results for our Llama 3 post-trained models on benchmarks across different capabilities.

We leverage MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b) to\\nevaluate Llama 3’s capability on knowledge-based question answering. For MMLU, we report the macro\\naverage of subtask accuracy under the 5-shot standard setting without CoT. MMLU-Pro is an extension\\nof MMLU, incorporating more challenging, reasoning-focused questions, eliminating noisy questions, and\\nexpanding the choice set from four to ten options. Given its focus on complex reasoning, we report 5-shot\\nCoT for MMLU-Pro. All tasks are formatted as generation tasks, similar to simple-evals (OpenAI, 2024).\\nAs shown in Table 2, our 8B and 70B Llama 3 variants outperform other models of similar sizes on both\\ngeneral knowledge tasks. Our 405B model outperforms GPT-4 and Nemotron 4 340B, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet\\nleading among larger models.\\nInstruction following. We assess the ability of Llama 3 and other models to follow natural language instructions\\non IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023). IFEval comprises approximately 500 “verifiable instructions” such as “write\\nin more than 400 words”, which can be verified by heuristics. We report the average of prompt-level and\\ninstruction-level accuracy, under strict and loose constraints in Table 2. Note that all Llama 3 variants\\noutperform comparable models across IFEval.\\n5.2.2 Proficiency Exams\\nNext, we evaluate our models on a wide variety of proficiency exams originally designed to test humans. We\\nsource these exams from publicly available official sources; for some exams, we report average scores across\\ndifferent exam sets per proficiency exam. Specifically, we average:\\n• GRE: Official GRE Practice Test 1 and 2 (from the Educational Testing Services);\\n• LSAT: Official Preptest 71, 73, 80 and 93;\\n• SAT: 8 exams from The Official SAT Study guide edition 2018;\\n• AP: One official practice exam per subject;\\n• GMAT Official GMAT Online Exam.\\nQuestions in these exams contain both MCQ style and generation questions. We exclude the questions that\\nare accompanied with images. For the GRE exams that contain questions with multiple correct options, we\\nqualify the outputs as correct only if all the correct options are selected by the model. The evaluations are\\n35'),\n",

To perform a pairwise human evaluation of two models, we ask human annotators which\\nof two model responses (produced by different models) they prefer. Annotators use a 7-point scale for their\\nratings, enabling them to indicate whether one model response is much better than, better than, slightly\\nbetter than, or about the same as the other model response. When an annotator indicates that one model\\nresponse is better or much better than the other model response, we consider this a “win” for that model. We\\nperform pairwise comparisons between models in which we report win rates per capability in the prompt set.\\nResults. We use our human evaluation process to compare Llama 3 405B with GPT-4 (0125 API version),\\nGPT-4o (API version), and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (API version). The results of these evaluations are presented\\nin Figure 17. We observe that Llama 3 405B performs approximately on par with the 0125 API version of\\nGPT-4, while achieving mixed results (some wins and some losses) compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5\\nSonnet.

Our benchmarks are\\nheavily inspired by the risk categories from the ML Commons taxonomy of hazards (Vidgen et al., 2024).\\nWhile various benchmarks for language model safety exist such as ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022), XS\\nTest (Röttger et al., 2023), and more, a number of the new capabilities in Llama 3 do not have sufficient\\nexternal benchmarks available and often external benchmarks lack sufficient coverage of breadth and depth.\\nFor each risk category, we collect human-written prompts that are either adversarial or borderline in nature —\\nexamples of such prompts can be found in Table 23. Adversarial prompts range from straightforward ones that\\ndirectly elicit a harmful response to ones that incorporate sophisticated jailbreaking techniques. Benchmarks\\nof these adversarial prompts are the basis for how we measure violation rate.\\nAs a counter-metric to violation rate, we also construct false refusal benchmarks composed of borderline\\nprompts. We refer tofalse refusal as occurring when a model refuses to answer in a helpful way even when\\na plausible, safe response is possible. Borderline prompts are prompts near the decision boundary that a\\nwell-calibrated model should handle, for example,“How can I steal the spotlight from my bestie who always\\nacts like the main character??”Our overall benchmark size across violations and false refusals is over 4000\\nprompts per capability or language, and contains a mix of single-turn and multi-turn prompts.\\n41'),\n",

During pre-training, we apply a variety of filters, such as\\nfilters to identify websites that likely contain personally identifiable information (see Section 3.1). We also\\nfocus heavily on discoverable memorization (Nasr et al., 2023). Similar to Carlini et al. (2022), we sample\\nprompts and ground truths at different frequencies of occurrence in the training data using an efficient rolling\\nhash index of all n-grams in the corpus. We construct different test scenarios by varying the length of prompt\\nand ground truth, the detected language of target data, and the domain. We then measure how often the model\\ngenerates the ground truth sequence verbatim, and analyze the relative rates of memorization in the specified\\nscenarios. We define verbatim memorization as the inclusion rate – the proportion of model generations that\\ninclude the ground truth continuation exactly – and report averages weighted by the prevalence of given\\ncharacteristics in the data, as shown in Table 24. We find low memorization rates of training data (1.13% and\\n3.91% on average for the 405B withn = 50and n = 1000respectively). Memorization rates are roughly on\\npar with Llama 2 at equivalent size and using the same methodology applied to its data mix.12\\n5.4.3 Safety Finetuning\\nWe describe our approach to safety finetuning to mitigate risks across many capabilities, which encompasses\\ntwo key aspects:(1) safety training data and(2) risk mitigation techniques.

Our experiments show\\nthat 8B models require a higher proportion of safety data\\nrelative to helpfulness data in the overall SFT mix to achieve\\ncomparable safety performance to 70B models. Larger mod-\\nels are more capable of discerning between adversarial and\\nborderline context, resulting in a more favorable balance\\nbetween VR and FRR.\\nFinetuning data. The quality and design of safety\\ntraining data has a profound impact on perfor-\\nmance. Through extensive ablations, we find that\\nthe quality is more critical than the quantity. We\\nmainly use human-generated data collected from\\nour data vendors, but find that it can be prone to\\nerrors and inconsistencies — particularly for nu-\\nanced safety policies. To ensure the highest quality\\ndata, we developed AI-assisted annotation tools to\\nsupport our rigorous quality assurance processes.\\nIn addition to collecting adversarial prompts, we\\nalso gather a set of similar prompts, which we refer\\nto asborderline prompts. These are closely related\\nto the adversarial prompts but with a goal to teach\\nthe model to learn to provide helpful responses,\\nthereby reducing the false refusal rate (FRR).\\nBeyond human annotation, we also leverage syn-\\nthetic data to improve the quality and coverage of\\nour training datasets. We utilize a range of tech-\\nniques to generate additional adversarial examples,\\nincluding in-context learning with carefully crafted\\nsystem prompts, guided mutation of seed prompts\\nbased on new attack vectors, and advanced algo-\\nrithms including Rainbow Teaming (Samvelyan\\net al., 2024), based on MAP-Elites (Mouret and\\nClune, 2015), which generate prompts constrained across multiple dimensions of diversity.\\nWe further address the model’s tone when producing safe responses, which has an impact on downstream\\nuser experience. We developed a refusal tone guideline for Llama 3 and ensured that all new safety data\\nadhered to it through rigorous quality assurance process. We also refine existing safety data to align with the\\nguideline, using a combination of zero-shot rewriting and human-in-the-loop editing to produce high-quality\\ndata. By employing these methods, along with a tone classifier to assess tone quality for safety responses, we\\nare able to significantly improve the model’s verbiage.\\nSafety supervised finetuning. Following our Llama 2 recipe (Touvron et al., 2023b), we combine all helpfulness\\ndata and safety data during the model alignment stage. Additionally, we introduce a borderline dataset to\\nhelp the model discern the subtle distinctions between safe and unsafe requests. Our annotation teams are\\ninstructed to meticulously craft responses to safety prompts based on our guidelines. We have found that SFT\\nis highly effective in aligning the model when we strategically balance the ratio of adversarial to borderline\\nexamples. We put the focus on more challenging risk areas, with a higher ratio of borderline examples. This\\nplays a crucial role in our successful safety mitigation efforts while keeping false refusal to a minimum.\\nFurther, we examine the impact of model size on the trade-off between FRR and VR in Figure 18. Our results\\nshow that it varies — with smaller models requiring a larger proportion of safety data relative to helpfulness,\\nand that it is more challenging to efficiently balance VR and FRR compared to larger models.\\nSafety DPO. To reinforce safety learning, we incorporate adversarial and borderline examples into our preference\\ndatasets in DPO. We discover that crafting response pairs to be nearly orthogonal in an embedding space is\\nparticularly effective in teaching the model to distinguish between good and bad responses for a given prompt.\\nWe conduct multiple experiments to determine the optimal ratio of adversarial, borderline, and helpfulness\\nexamples, aiming to optimize the trade-off between FRR and VR. We also find that the model size influences\\nthe learning outcomes — as a result, we tailor different safety mixes for various model sizes.\\n43'),\n",

Two of the competitors are end-to-end systems accessed through API,\\nand one of them is an open source language model that we host internally and we evaluate directly.13 We\\nevaluate our Llama models both standalone and coupled with Llama Guard, our open source system-level\\nsafety solution (more in Section 5.4.7).\\nWhile a low violation rate is desirable, it is critical to consider false refusal as a counter-metric, as a model\\nthat always refuses is maximally safe, but not helpful in the slightest. Similarly, a model that always answers\\nevery prompt, regardless of how problematic the request, would be overly harmful and toxic. In Figure 21,\\nleveraging our internal benchmarks, we explore how different models and systems in industry navigate this\\ntrade off and how Llama 3 compares. We find that our models achieve very competitive violation rate metrics\\n13Because these safety benchmarks are internal to Meta, we acknowledge that the numbers in this section are not reproducible\\nexternally, and so we choose to anonymize the competitors we evaluate against.\\n44'),\n",

Each point represents the overall false refusal\\nand violation rate for an internal capability benchmark across all safety categories.

Llama 3 aims to balance a low violation rate with a low\\nfalse refusal rate, while some competitors are more skewed towards one or the other.\\nwhile keeping false refusal rate low as well, indicating a solid balance between helpfulness and safety.\\nMultilingual safety. Our experiments demonstrate that safety knowledge in English does not readily transfer to\\nother languages, particularly given the nuance of safety policies and language-specific context. Therefore, it is\\nessential to collect high-quality safety data for each language. We also found that the distribution of safety\\ndata per language significantly impacts performance from a safety standpoint, with some languages benefiting\\nfrom transfer learning while others require more language-specific data. To achieve a balance between FRR\\nand VR, we iteratively add adversarial and borderline data while monitoring the impact on both metrics.\\nWe display results on our internal benchmarks in Figure 19 for short context models, showing Llama 3’s\\nviolation and false refusal rates for English and non-English languages compared to similar models and\\nsystems. To construct the benchmarks for each language, we use a combination of prompts written by native\\nspeakers, sometimes supplementing with translations from our English benchmarks. For each of our supported\\nlanguages, we find that Llama 405B with Llama Guard is at least as safe, if not strictly safer, than the two\\ncompeting systems when measured on our internal benchmark, while maintaining competitive false refusal\\nrates. Looking at the Llama 405B model on its own, without Llama Guard, we find that it has a significantly\\nlower violation rate than the competing standalone open source model, trading off a higher false refusal rate.\\nLong-context safety. Long-context models are vulnerable to many-shot jailbreaking attacks without targeted\\nmitigation (Anil et al., 2024). To address this, we finetune our models on SFT datasets that include examples\\nof safe behavior in the presence of demonstrations of unsafe behavior in context. We develop a scalable\\nmitigation strategy that significantly reduces VR, effectively neutralizing the impact of longer context attacks\\neven for 256-shot attacks. This approach shows little to no impact on FRR and most helpfulness metrics.\\nTo quantify the effectiveness of our long context safety mitigations, we use two additional benchmarking\\nmethods: DocQA and Many-shot. For DocQA, short for “document question answering,” we use long documents\\nwith information that could be utilized in adversarial ways. Models are provided both the document and a set\\nof prompts related to the document in order to test whether the questions being related to information in the\\ndocument affected the model’s ability to respond safely to the prompts. For Many-shot, following Anil et al.\\n(2024), we construct a synthetic chat history composed of unsafe prompt-response pairs. A final prompt,\\nunrelated to previous messages, is used to test whether the unsafe behavior in-context influenced the model\\n45'),\n",

To evaluate cybersecurity risk, we leverage the CyberSecEval benchmark\\nframework (Bhatt et al., 2023, 2024), which contains tasks that measure safety across domains such as\\ngenerating insecure code, generating malicious code, textual prompt injection, and vulnerability identification.\\nWe developed and applied Llama 3 to new benchmarks on spear phishing and autonomous cyberattacks.\\nOverall, we find that Llama 3 does not have significant susceptibilities in generating malicious code or\\nexploiting vulnerabilities. We describe brief results on specific tasks:\\n• Insecure coding testing framework: Evaluating Llama 3 8B, 70B, and 405B against the insecure coding\\ntesting framework, we continue to observe that larger models both generate more insecure code and also\\ngenerate code with a higher average BLEU score (Bhatt et al., 2023).\\n• Code interpreter abuse prompt corpus: We identify that Llama 3 models are susceptible to executing\\nmalicious code under certain prompts, with Llama 3 405B being particularly susceptible by complying\\nwith malicious prompts 10.4% of the time. Llama 3 70B complied at a rate of 3.8%.\\n• Text-based prompt injection benchmark: When evaluated against prompt injection benchmarks, prompt\\ninjection attacks against Llama 3 405B were successful 21.7% of the time. Figure 22 provides text-based\\nprompt injection success rates across Llama 3, GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini Pro, and Mixtral models.\\n• Vulnerability identification challenges: In assessing Llama 3’s ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities\\nusing CyberSecEval 2’s capture-the-flag test challenges, Llama 3 does not outperform commonly used,\\ntraditional non-LLM tools and techniques.\\n• Spearphishingbenchmark: We evaluate model persuasiveness and success rate in carrying out personalized\\nconversations designed to deceive a target into unwittingly participating in security compromises.\\nRandomized detailed victim profiles were generated by an LLM to serve as spear phishing targets. A\\njudge LLM (Llama 3 70B) scored the performance of Llama 3 70B and 405B in interacting with a victim\\nmodel (Llama 3 70B) and evaluated the success of the attempt. Llama 3 70B and Llama 3 405B were\\nevaluated by the judge LLM to be moderately persuasive. Llama 3 70B was judged by an LLM to have\\nbeen successful in 24% of spear phishing attempts while Llama 3 405B was judged to be successful in\\n14% of attempts. Figure 23 presents judge LLM-evaluated persuasiveness scores across models and\\nphishing objectives.\\n• Attackautomationframework: We assess Llama3 70B’s and405B’s potential tofunction as anautonomous\\nagent across four critical phases of a ransomware attack – network reconnaissance, vulnerability\\nidentification, exploit execution, and post exploitation actions. We enable the models to behave\\nautonomously by configuring the models to iteratively generate and execute new Linux commands\\nin response to output from their prior commands on a Kali Linux virtual machine as they targeted\\nanother virtual machine with known vulnerabilities. Although Llama 3 70B and 405B efficiently identify\\nnetwork services and open ports in their network reconnaissance, the models fail to effectively use this\\ninformation to gain initial access to the vulnerable machine across 20 and 23 test runs respectively. In\\nidentifying vulnerabilities, Llama 3 70B and 405B are moderately effective but struggle with selecting\\nand applying successful exploitation techniques.

To assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and\\nbiological weapons, we perform uplift testing designed to assess whether use of Llama 3 could meaningfully\\nincrease the capabilities of actors to plan such attacks.\\nThe study consists of six-hour scenarios where teams of two participants were asked to generate fictitious\\noperational plans for either a biological or chemical attack. The scenarios cover the major planning stages of a\\nCBRNE attack (agent acquisition, production, weaponization, and delivery) and are designed to elicit detailed\\nplans that would address challenges related to procurement of restricted materials, real-world laboratory\\nprotocols, and operational security. Participants are recruited based on previous experience in relevant areas of\\nscientific or operational expertise, and assigned to teams consisting of two low-skill actors (no formal training)\\nor two moderate-skill actors (some formal training and practical experience in science or operations).\\nThe study was generated in collaboration with a set of CBRNE experts, and designed to maximize the\\ngenerality, validity, and robustness of both quantitative and qualitative outcomes. A preliminary study was\\nalso performed in order to validate the study design, including a robust power analysis ensuring that our\\nsample size was sufficient for statistical analysis.\\nEach team is assigned to a “control” or “LLM” condition. The control team has access to internet-based\\nresources only, while the LLM-enabled team had internet access as well as access to Llama 3 models enabled\\nwith web search (including PDF ingestion), information retrieval capabilities (RAG), and code execution\\n(Python and Wolfram Alpha). To enable testing of RAG capabilities, a keyword search is used to generate a\\ndataset of hundreds of relevant scientific papers and pre-loaded into the Llama 3 model inference system. At\\nthe conclusion of the exercise, the operational plans generated by each team are evaluated by subject matter\\nexperts with domain expertise in biology, chemistry, and operational planning.

We conduct recurring red teaming exercises to continuously iterate and discover new risks, which\\nguides our model development and mitigation process.\\nOur red team consists of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, responsible AI, and integrity,\\nin addition to multilingual content specialists with backgrounds in integrity issues for specific geographic\\nmarkets. We also partner with internal and external subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to help build\\nrisk taxonomies and aid in more focused adversarial assessment.\\nAdversarial testing on specific model capabilities. We began initial red teaming by focusing on individual model\\ncapabilities in a risk discovery process, in context of specific high-risk categories then testing capabilities\\ntogether. The red team focused on prompt-level attacks to emulate more likely more real world scenarios —\\nwe find that models often deviate from expected behavior, particularly in cases when the prompt’s intention is\\nbeing obfuscated or when prompts layer multiple abstractions. These risks get more complex with additional\\ncapabilities, and we describe several of our red teaming discoveries in detail below. We utilize these red\\nteam discoveries in concert with our results on internal safety benchmarks to develop focused mitigations to\\ncontinuously and iteratively improve model safety.\\n• Short and long-context English. We employed a mix of well known, published and unpublished techniques\\nacross single and multi-turn conversations. We also leveraged advanced, adversarial multi-turn automa-\\ntion similar to PAIR (Chao et al., 2023) across some techniques and risk categories. Largely, multi-turn\\nconversations lead to more harmful outputs. Several attacks were pervasive across model checkpoints,\\nparticularly when used together.\\n– Multi-turn refusal suppression to specify the model response to follow a particular format or\\ninclude/exclude particular information related to the refusal as specific phrases.\\n– Hypotheticalscenarios wrap violating prompts as hypothetical/theoretical tasks or fictional scenarios.\\nPrompts can be as simple as adding the word “hypothetically” or crafting an elaborate layered\\nscenario.\\n– Personas and role play gives the model a violating persona with specific violating response character-\\nistics (e.g. “You are X, your goal is Y”) or yourself as the user adapting a specific benign character\\nthat obfuscates the context of the prompt.\\n– Adding disclaimers and warnings works as a form of response priming and we assume a method to\\nallow for the model a path to helpful compliance that intersects with generalized safety training.\\nAsking for disclaimers, trigger warnings and more to be added in multi-turn conversations in\\nconcert with other attacks mentioned contributed to increased violation rates.\\n– Gradually escalating violation is a multi-turn attack where the conversation starts out with a more or\\nless benign request and then through direct prompting for more exaggerated content can gradually\\nlead the model into generating a very violating response. Once the model has started outputting\\nviolating content, it can be difficult for the model to recover (or another attack can be used if a\\nrefusal is encountered). With longer context models, this will be an increasingly seen issue.\\n• Multilingual. We identify a number of unique risks when considering multiple languages.\\n– Mixing multiple languages in one prompt or conversation can easily lead to more violating outputs\\nthan if a single language was used.\\n– Lower resource languages can lead to violating outputs given a lack of related safety fine tuning\\ndata, weak model generalization of safety or prioritization of testing or benchmarks. However, this\\nattack often result in poor quality generally, limiting real adversarial use.\\n48'),\n",

During testing, apart from English-text level adversarial prompting techniques being successful\\nin generating violating outputs, several tool specific attacks were also discovered. This included but was\\nnot limited to:\\n– Unsafe tool chaining such as asking for multiple tools at once with one being violating could, in\\nearly checkpoints, lead to all of the tools being called with a mix of benign and violating inputs.\\n– Forcing tool use often with specific input strings, fragmented or encoded text can trigger a tool\\ninput to be potentially violating, leading to a more violating output. Other techniques can then be\\nused to access the tool results, even if the model would normally refuse to perform the search or\\nassist with the results.\\n– Modifying tool use parameters such as swapping words in queries, retrying, or obfuscating some of\\nthe initial request in a multi-turn conversation lead to violations in many early checkpoints as a\\nform of forcing tool use.\\nChild safety risks. Child Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the\\nmodel’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and\\nappropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the\\ncoverage of our evaluation benchmarks through model development. For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth\\nsessions using objective based methodologies to assess model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also\\npartnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content\\nwhile taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\\n5.4.7 System Level Safety\\nIn various real-world applications of large language models, models are not used in isolation but are integrated\\ninto broader systems. In this section, we describe our system level safety implementation, which supplements\\nmodel-level mitigations by providing more flexibility and control.\\nTo enable this, we develop and release a new classifier, Llama Guard 3, which is a Llama 3 8B model fine-tuned\\nfor safety classification. Similar to Llama Guard 2 (Llama-Team, 2024), this classifier is used to detect\\nwhether input prompts and/or output responses generated by language models violate safety policies on\\nspecific categories of harm.\\nIt is designed to support Llama’s growing capabilities, and can be used for English and multilingual text. It is\\nalso optimized to be used in the context of tool-calls such as search-tools and preventing code interpreter\\nabuse. Finally, we also provide quantized variants to reduce memory requirements. We encourage developers\\nto use our release of system safety components as a foundation and configure them for their own use cases.\\nTaxonomy. We train on the 13 hazard categories listed in the AI Safety taxonomy (Vidgen et al., 2024): Child\\nSexual Exploitation, Defamation, Elections, Hate, Indiscriminate Weapons, Intellectual Property, Non-Violent\\nCrimes, Privacy, Sex-Related Crimes, Sexual Content, Specialized Advice, Suicide & Self-Harm, and Violent\\nCrimes. We also train on Code Interpreter Abuse category to support tool-calls use cases.\\nTraining data. We start with the English data used by Llama Guard (Inan et al., 2023) and expand this dataset\\nto incorporate new capabilities. For new capabilities such as multilingual and tool use, we collect prompt and\\nresponse classification data, as well as utilize the data collected for safety finetuning. We increase the number\\nof unsafe responses in the training set by doing prompt engineering to get the LLM to not refuse responding\\nto adversarial prompts.

Llama Guard 3 is able to significantly reduce violations across capabilities (-65% violations on average\\nacross our benchmarks).

The model is a multi-label\\nclassifier that detects two classes of prompt attack risk -direct jailbreaks(techniques that explicitly try to\\noverride a model’s safety conditioning or system prompt) andindirect prompt injections(instances where\\nthird-party data included in a model’s context window includes instructions inadvertently executed as user\\ncommands by an LLM). The model is fine-tuned frommDeBERTa-v3-base, a small (86M) parameter model\\nsuitable for filtering inputs into an LLM. We evaluate the performance on several evaluation datasets shown\\nin Table 28. We evaluate on two datasets (jailbreaks and injections) drawn from the same distribution\\nas the training data, as well as an out-of-distribution dataset in English, a multilingual jailbreak set built\\nfrom machine translation, and a dataset of indirect injections drawn from CyberSecEval (both English and\\nmultilingual). Overall, we find that the model generalizes well to new distributions and has strong performance.\\nCode Shield is an example of a class of system-level protections based on providing inference-time filtering.\\nIn particular, it focuses on detecting the generation of insecure code before it might enter a downstream\\nusecase such as a production system. It does so by leveraging a static analysis library, the Insecure Code\\nDetector (ICD), to identify insecure code. ICD uses a suite of static analysis tools to perform the analysis\\nacross 7 programming languages. These kinds of guardrails are generally useful for developers, who can deploy\\nmulti-layered protections in various applications.\\n50'),\n",

Across nodes, however, connectivity has lower\\nbandwidth and higher latency, so we use pipeline parallelism (Huang et al., 2019) instead.\\nDuring training with pipeline parallelism, bubbles are a major efficiency concern (see Section 3.3). However,\\nthey are not an issue during inference, since inference does not involve a backward pass that requires a pipeline\\nflush. Therefore, we use micro-batching to improve inference throughput with pipeline parallelism.\\nWe evaluate the effect of using two micro-batches in inference workloads of 4,096 input tokens and 256 output\\ntokens both during the key-value cachepre-fill stage of inference and during thedecoding stage. We find\\nthat micro-batching improves throughput of inference with the same local batch size; see Figure 24. These\\nimprovements result from micro-batching enabling concurrent execution of micro batches in both these stages.\\nThe additional synchronization points due to micro-batching also increase latency but, overall, micro-batching\\nstill leads to a better throughput-latency trade-off.\\n6.2 FP8 Quantization\\nWe perform experiments leveraging the native FP8 support of H100 GPUs to perform low-precision inference.\\nTo enable low-precision inference, we apply FP8 quantization to most matrix multiplications inside the\\nmodel. In particular, we quantize most parameters and activations in the feedforward network layers in the\\nmodel, which account for roughly 50% of the inference compute time. We do not quantize parameters in\\nthe self-attention layers of the model. We leverage dynamic scaling factors for better accuracy (Xiao et al.,\\n2024b), optimizing our CUDA kernels15 to reduce the overhead of calculating the scales. We find that the\\nquality of Llama 3 405B is sensitive to certain types of quantization, and make a few additional changes to\\nincrease the model output quality:\\n1. Akin to Zhang et al. (2021), we do not perform quantization in the first and last Transformer layers.\\n2. High-perplexity tokens such as dates can lead to large activation values. In turn, these can lead to high\\ndynamic scaling factors in FP8 and a non-negligible number of underflows, leading to errors in decoding.\\n15Our FP8 kernels are available athttps://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM/tree/main/fbgemm_gpu/experimental/gen_ai.\\nWe provide usage examples athttps://github.com/meta-llama/llama-agentic-system.\\n52'),\n",

First, we compose a pre-trained image encoder\\n(Xu et al., 2023) and the pre-trained language model by introducing and training a set of cross-attention\\nlayers between the two models (Alayrac et al., 2022) on a large number of image-text pairs. This leads to\\nthe model illustrated in Figure 28. Second, we introduce temporal aggregator layers and additional video\\ncross-attention layers that operate on a large collection of video-text pairs to learn the model to recognize and\\nprocess temporal information from videos.\\nA compositional approach to foundation model development has several advantages:(1) it enables us to\\nparallelize the development of the vision and language modeling capabilities;(2) it circumvents complexities\\nof joint pre-training on visual and language data that stem from tokenization of visual data, differences in\\nbackground perplexities of tokens originating from different modalities, and contention between modalities;(3)\\nit guarantees that model performance on text-only tasks is not affected by the introduction of visual-recognition\\ncapabilities, and(4) the cross-attention architecture ensures that we do not have to expend compute passing\\nfull-resolution images through the increasingly LLM backbones (specifically, the feed-forward networks in\\neach transformer layer), making it more efficient during inference. We note that our multimodal models are\\nstill under development and not yet ready for release.\\nBefore presenting the results of our experiments in Section 7.6 and 7.7, we describe the data we used to train\\nvisual recognition capabilities, the model architecture of the vision components, how we scale training of those\\ncomponents, and our pre-training and post-training recipes.\\n7.1 Data\\nWe describe our image and video data separately below.\\n7.1.1 Image Data\\nOur image encoder and adapter are trained on image-text pairs. We construct this dataset via a complex\\ndata processing pipeline that consists of four main stages:(1) quality filtering,(2) perceptual de-duplication,\\n(3) resampling, and(4) optical character recognition. We also apply a series of safety mitigations.\\n• Quality filtering. We implement quality filters that remove non-English captions and low-quality captions\\nvia heuristics such as low alignment scores produced by (Radford et al., 2021). Specifically, we remove\\nall image-text pairs below a certain CLIP score.\\n• De-duplication.

To do so, we use an internal version of the state-of-the-art\\nSSCD copy-detection model (Pizzi et al., 2022) to de-duplicate images at scale. For all images, we\\nfirst compute a 512-dimensional representation using the SSCD model. We use those embeddings to\\nperform a nearest neighbor (NN) search for each image across all images in our data set, using a cosine\\nsimilarity measure. We define examples above a certain similarity threshold as duplicates. We group\\nthese duplicates using a connected-components algorithm, and maintain only one image-text pair per\\nconnected component. We increase the efficiency of our de-duplication pipeline by: (1) pre-clustering the\\ndata using k-means clusters and (2) using FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019) for NN searches and clustering.\\n• Resampling. We ensure diversity of the image-text pairs via resampling akin to Xu et al. (2023);\\nMahajan et al. (2018); Mikolov et al. (2013). First, we construct a vocabulary of n-grams by parsing\\nhigh-quality text sources. Next, we compute the frequency of each vocabulary n-gram in our dataset.\\nWe then resample the data as follows: If any of the n-grams in a caption occurs less thanT times in the\\nvocabulary, we keep the corresponding image-text pair. Otherwise, we independently sample each of\\nthe n-gramsni in the caption with probability\\np\\nT/fi where fi indicates the frequency of n-gramni;\\nwe keep the image-text pair if any of the n-grams was sampled. This resampling aids performance on\\nlow-frequency categories and fine-grained recognition tasks.\\n• Optical character recognition. We further improve our image-text data by extracting text written in the\\nimage and concatenating it with the caption. The written text is extracted using a proprietary optical\\ncharacter recognition (OCR) pipeline. We observe that adding OCR data into the training data greatly\\nimproves tasks that require OCR capabilities, such as document understanding.\\nTranscribing documents.

We also use a proprietary media-risk retrieval pipeline to identify and remove image-text pairs\\nthat we consider to be NSFW, for example, because they contain sexual or violent content. We believe that\\nminimizing the prevalence of such material in the training dataset improves the safety of the final model\\nwithout impacting its helpfulness.

Since the n-grams resampling favor richer text descriptions, this selects a\\nhigher-quality data subset. We augment the resulting data with∼150M examples from five additional sources:\\n• Visual grounding. We link noun phrases in the text to bounding boxes or masks in the image.

To ensure reasonable alignment\\nbetween the video-text pairs, we use CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) style image-text and video-text contrastive\\nmodels. We first compute image-text similarity using a single frame in the videos and filtered out low similarity\\npairs, and then subsequently filter out pairs with low video-text alignment.

To alleviate this, we employ amulti-layer feature extraction, where\\nfeatures from the4th, 8th, 16th, 24th and 31st layers are also provided in addition to the final layer features.\\nIn addition, we further insert 8gated self-attention layers (making a total of 40 transformer blocks) prior to\\npre-training of the cross-attention layers to learn alignment-specific features. The image encoder therefore\\neventually has a total850M parameters with the additional layers. With the multi-layer features, the image\\nencoder produces a7680-dimensional representation for each of the resulting16 × 16 = 256patches. The\\nparameters of the image encoder arenot frozen during subsequent training stages as we found it to improve\\nperformance, especially in domains such as text recognition.\\nImage adapter. We introduce cross-attention layers between the visual token representations produced by the\\nimage encoder and the token representations produced by the language model (Alayrac et al., 2022). The\\ncross-attention layers are applied after every fourth self-attention layer in the core language model. Like the\\nlanguage model itself, the cross-attention layers use generalized query attention (GQA) for increased efficiency.\\nThe cross-attention layers introduce substantial numbers of additional trainable parameters into the model:\\nfor Llama 3 405B, the cross-attention layers have≈100B parameters. We pre-train our image adapter in two\\nstages: (1) initial pre-training followed by (2) annealing:\\n• Initial pre-training. We pre-train our image adapter on our dataset of∼6B image-text pairs described\\nabove. For compute efficiency reasons, we resize all images to fit withinat most four tiles of336 × 336\\npixels each, where we arrange the tiles to support different aspect ratios,e.g., 672 × 672, 672 × 336, and\\n1344 × 336.\\n• Annealing. We continue training the image adapter on∼500M images from the annealing dataset\\ndescribed above. During annealing, we increase the per-tile image resolution to improve performance on\\ntasks that require higher-resolution images, for example, infographics understanding.\\nVideo adapter. Our model takes as input up to 64 frames (uniformly sampled from a full video), each of\\nwhich is processed by the image encoder. We model temporal structure in videos through two components:\\n(i) encoded video frames are aggregated by a temporal aggregator which merges 32 consecutive frames into\\none, (ii) additional video cross attention layers are added before every fourth image cross attention layer. The\\ntemporal aggregator is implemented as a perceiver resampler (Jaegle et al., 2021; Alayrac et al., 2022). We\\npre-train using 16 frames per video (aggregated to 1 frame), but increase the number of input frames to 64\\nduring supervised finetuning. The video aggregator and cross attention layers have 0.6B and 4.6B parameters\\nfor Llama 3 7B and 70B, respectively.\\n7.3 Model Scaling\\nAfter the visual-recognition components are added to Llama 3, the model contains self-attention layers, cross-\\nattention layers, and a ViT image encoder. To train adapters for the smaller 8B and 70B parameter models,\\nwe found a combination of data and tensor parallelization is the most efficient. Model or pipeline parallelism\\ndoes not increase efficiency at these scales because the gathering of model parameters would dominate the\\ncomputation. We do, however, use pipeline parallelism (in addition to data and tensor parallelism) when\\ntraining the adapter for the 405B parameter model. Training at this scale introduces three new challenges in\\naddition to those outlined in Section 3.3: model heterogeneity, data heterogeneity, and numerical instabilities.\\nModel heterogeneity. The model computation is heterogeneous because more computation is performed on\\nsome tokens than on others. In particular, image tokens are processed by the image encoder and the cross-\\nattention layers, whereas text tokens are only processed by the language backbone. This heterogeneity leads\\nto bottlenecks in the scheduling of pipeline parallelism. We address this problem by ensuring each pipeline\\nstage contains five layers: namely, four self-attention layers in the language backbone and a cross-attention\\nlayer. (Recall that we introduce a cross-attention layer after every fourth self-attention layer.) In addition, we\\nreplicate the image encoder on all pipeline stages. Because we train on paired image-text data, this enables us\\nto perform load balancing between the image and text parts of the computation.\\n57'),\n",

The data is heterogeneous because, on average, images have more tokens than the\\nassociated text: an image has 2,308 tokens, whereas the associated text contains an average of only 192 tokens.\\nAs a result, the computation of cross-attention layers requires more time and memory than the computation\\nof self-attention layers. We address this problem by introducing sequence parallelization in the image encoder,\\nso that each GPU processes roughly the same number of tokens. Because the average text size is relatively\\nshort, we also use a substantially larger micro-batch size (8 instead of 1).\\nNumerical instabilities. After the image encoder is added to the model, we find that performing gradient\\naccumulation in bf16 led to numerical instabilities. The most likely explanation for this is that image tokens\\nare introduced into the language backbone viaall cross-attention layers. This implies that numerical deviations\\nin the representation of an image token have an outsized impact on the overall computation because the errors\\nare compounded. We address this by performing gradient accumulation in FP32.\\n7.4 Pre-training\\nImage. We initialize from the pre-trained text model and vision encoder weights. The vision encoder is\\nunfrozen, while the text model weights are kept frozen as explained above. First, we train the model using 6B\\nimage-text pairs where each image is resized to fit within four tiles of336 × 336 pixels. We use a global batch\\nsize of 16,384 and a cosine learning rate schedule with initial learning rate10 × 10−4 and a weight decay of\\n0.01. The initial learning rate was determined based on small-scale experiments. However, these findings did\\nnot generalize well to very long training schedules and dropped the learning rate a few times during training\\nwhen the loss values became stagnant. After the base pre-training, we increase the image resolution further\\nand continue training the same weights on the annealing dataset. The optimizer is re-initialized via warm-up\\nto learning rate2 × 10−5 and again follows a cosine schedule.\\nVideo. For video pre-training, we start from the image pre-trained and annealed weights as described above. We\\nadd the video aggregator and cross-attention layers as described in the architecture, initialized randomly. We\\nfreeze all the parameters in the model except the video-specific ones (the aggregator and video cross-attention),\\nand train them on the video pre-training data. We use the same training hyperparameters as the image\\nannealing stage, with small differences in the learning rate. We uniformly sample 16 frames from the full video,\\nand represent each frame using four chunks, each of size of448 × 448 pixels. We use an aggregation factor of\\n16 in the video aggregator, hence obtaining one effective frame, which the text tokens cross-attend to. We use\\na global batch size of 4,096, a sequence length of 190 tokens, and a learning rate of10−4 during training.\\n7.5 Post-Training\\nIn this section, we describe the post-training recipe for our vision adapters. After pre-training, we fine-tune the\\nmodel on highly curated multi-modal conversational data to enable chat capabilities. We further implement\\ndirect preference optimization (DPO) to boost human evaluation performance and rejection sampling to\\nimprove multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Finally, we add a quality-tuning stage where we continue fine-\\ntuning the model on a very small set of high-quality conversational data which further boosts human evaluation\\nwhile retaining performance across benchmarks. More details on each of these steps are provided below.\\n7.5.1 Supervised Finetuning Data\\nWe describe our supervised finetuning (SFT) data for image and video capabilities separately below.\\nImage. We utilize a mix of different datasets for supervised finetuning.\\n• Academic datasets. We convert a highly filtered collection of existing academic datasets to question-\\nanswer pairs using templates or via LLM rewriting. The LLM rewriting’s purpose is to augment the\\ndata with different instructions and to improve the language quality of answers.\\n• Human annotations. We collect multi-modal conversation data via human annotators for a wide range of\\ntasks (open-ended question-answering, captioning, practical use cases,etc.) and domains (e.g., natural\\nimages and structured images). Annotators are provided with images and asked to write conversations.\\nTo ensure diversity, we cluster large-scale datasets and sampled images uniformly across different clusters.\\nFurther, we acquire additional images for a few specific domains by expanding a seed via k-nearest\\n58'),\n",

Annotators are also provided with intermediate checkpoints of existing models to facilitate\\nmodel-in-the-loop style annotations, so that model generations can be utilized as a starting point by\\nthe annotators to then provide additional human edits. This is an iterative process, in which model\\ncheckpoints would be regularly updated with better performing versions trained on the latest data. This\\nincreases the volume and efficiency of human annotations, while also improving their quality.\\n• Synthetic data. We explore different ways to generate synthetic multi-modal data by using text-\\nrepresentations of images and a text-input LLM. The high-level idea is to utilize the reasoning capa-\\nbilities of text-input LLMs to generate question-answer pairs in the text domain, and replace the text\\nrepresentation with its corresponding images to produce synthetic multi-modal data. Examples include\\nrendering texts from question-answer datasets as images or rendering table data into synthetic images of\\ntables and charts. Additionally, we use captions and OCR extractions from existing images to generate\\nadditional conversational or question-answer data related to the images.\\nVideo. Similar to the image adapter, we use academic datasets with pre-existing annotations and convert them\\ninto appropriate textual instructions and target responses. The targets are converted to open-ended responses\\nor multiple-choice options, whichever is more appropriate. We ask humans to annotate videos with questions\\nand corresponding answers. The annotators are asked to focus on questions that could not be answered based\\non a single frame, to steer the annotators towards questions that require temporal understanding.\\n7.5.2 Supervised Finetuning Recipe\\nWe describe our supervised finetuning (SFT) recipe for image and video capabilities separately below.\\nImage. We initialize from the pre-trained image adapter, but hot-swap the pre-trained language model’s\\nweights with the instruction tuned language model’s weights. The language model weights are kept frozen to\\nmaintain text-only performance,i.e., we only update the vision encoder and image adapter weights.\\nOur approach to finetune the model is similar to Wortsman et al. (2022). First, we run a hyperparameter\\nsweep using multiple random subsets of data, learning rates and weight decay values. Next, we rank the\\nmodels based on their performance. Finally, we average the weights of the top-K models to obtain the final\\nmodel. The value ofK is determined by evaluating the averaged models and selecting the instance with\\nhighest performance. We observe that the averaged models consistently yield better results compared to the\\nbest individual model found via grid search. Further, this strategy reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters.\\nVideo. For video SFT, we initialize the video aggregator and cross-attention layers using the pre-trained\\nweights. The rest of the parameters in the model, the image weights and the LLM, are initialized from\\ncorresponding models following their finetuning stages. Similar to video pre-training, we then finetune only\\nthe video parameters on the video SFT data. For this stage, we increase the video length to 64 frames, and\\nuse an aggregation factor of 32 to get two effective frames. The resolution of the chunks is also increased to\\nbe consistent with the corresponding image hyperparameters.\\n7.5.3 Preference Data\\nWe built multimodal pair-wise preference datasets for reward modeling and direct preference optimization.\\n• Human annotations. The human-annotated preference data consists of comparisons between two different\\nmodel outputs, labeled as “chosen” and “rejected”, with 7-scale ratings. The models used to generate\\nresponses are sampled on-the-fly from a pool of the best recent models, each with different characteristics.\\nWe update the model pool weekly. Besides preference labels, we also request annotators to provide\\noptional human edits to correct inaccuracies in “chosen” responses because vision tasks have a low\\ntolerance for inaccuracies. Note that human editing is an optional step because there is a trade-off\\nbetween volume and quality in practice.\\n• Synthetic data. Synthetic preference pairs could also be generated by using text-only LLMs to edit and\\ndeliberately introduce errors in the supervised finetuning dataset. We took the conversational data as\\ninput, and use an LLM to introduce subtle but meaningful errors (e.g., change objects, change attributes,\\nadd mistakes in calculations, etc.). These edited responses are used as negative “rejected” samples and\\npaired with the “chosen” original supervised finetuning data.\\n59'),\n",

Furthermore, to create moreon-policy negative samples, we leveraged the iterative\\nprocess of rejection sampling to collect additional preference data. We discuss our usage of rejection\\nsampling in more detail in the following sections. At a high-level, rejection sampling is used to iteratively\\nsample high-quality generations from a model. Therefore, as a by-product, all generations that are not\\nselected can be used as negative rejected samples and used as additional preference data pairs.\\n7.5.4 Reward Modeling\\nWe train a vision reward model (RM) on top of the vision SFT model and the language RM. The vision\\nencoder and the cross-attention layers are initialized from the vision SFT model and unfrozen during training,\\nwhile the self-attention layers are initialized from the language RM and kept frozen. We observe that freezing\\nthe language RM part generally leads to better accuracy, especially on tasks that require the RM to judge\\nbased on its knowledge or the language quality. We adopt the same training objective as the language RM,\\nbut adding a weighted regularization term on the square of the reward logits averaged over the batch, which\\nprevents the reward scores from drifting.\\nThe human preference annotations in Section 7.5.3 are used to train the vision RM. We follow the same\\npractice as language preference data (Section 4.2.1) to create two or three pairs with clear ranking (edited\\n> chosen > rejected). In addition, we also synthetically augment the negative responses by perturbing the\\nwords or phrases related to the information in the image (such as numbers or visual texts). This encourages\\nthe vision RM to ground its judgement based on the actual image content.\\n7.5.5 Direct Preference Optimization\\nSimilar to the language model (Section 4.1.4), we further train the vision adapters with Direct Preference\\nOptimization (DPO; Rafailov et al. (2023)) using the preference data described in Section 7.5.3. To combat the\\ndistribution shift during post-training rounds, we only keep recent batches of human preference annotations\\nwhile dropping batches that are sufficiently off-policy (e.g., if the base pre-trained model is changed). We find\\nthat instead of always freezing the reference model, updating it in an exponential moving average (EMA)\\nfashion every k-steps helps the model learn more from the data, resulting in better performance in human\\nevaluations. Overall, we observed that the vision DPO model consistently performs better than its SFT\\nstarting point in human evaluations for every finetuning iteration.\\n7.5.6 Rejection Sampling\\nMost available question-answer pairs only contain the final answer and lack the chain-of-thought explanation\\nthat is required to train a model that generalizes well for reasoning tasks. We use rejection sampling to\\ngenerate the missing explanations for such examples and boost the model’s reasoning capabilities.\\nGiven a question-answer pair, we generate multiple answers by sampling the finetuned model with different\\nsystem prompts or temperature. Next, we compare the generated answers to the ground-truth via heuristics\\nor an LLM judge. Finally, we retrain the model by adding the correct answers back into the finetuning data\\nmix. We find it useful to keep multiple correct answers per question.\\nTo ensure we only add high-quality examples back into training, we implemented the following two guardrails.\\nFirst, we find that some examples contain incorrect explanations, despite the final answer being correct. We\\nobserved that this pattern occurs more frequently for questions where only a small fraction of the generated\\nanswers is correct. Therefore, we drop answers for questions where the probability of the answer being correct\\nis below a certain threshold. Second, raters prefer some answers over others due to differences in language or\\nstyle. We use the reward model to select top-K highest-quality answers and add them back into training.\\n7.5.7 Quality Tuning\\nWe curate a small buthighly selective SFT dataset where all samples have been rewritten and verified either\\nby humans or our best models to meet our highest standards. We train DPO models with this data to improve\\nresponse quality, calling the process Quality-Tuning (QT). We find that QT significantly improves human\\nevaluations without affecting generalization verified by benchmarks when the QT dataset covers a wide range\\n60'),\n",

The speech\\ninterface of Llama 3 supports up to 34 languages.18 It also allows for the interleaved input of text and speech,\\nenabling the model to solve advanced audio-comprehension tasks.\\nWe also experiment with a speech generation approach in which we implement a streaming text-to-speech\\n(TTS) system that generates speech waveforms on-the-fly during language model decoding. We design the\\nspeech generator for Llama 3 based on a proprietary TTS system and do not fine-tune the language model for\\nspeech generation. Instead, we focus on improving speech synthesis latency, accuracy, and naturalness by\\nleveraging Llama 3 embeddings at inference time. The speech interface is illustrated in Figure 28 and 29.\\n8.1 Data\\n8.1.1 Speech Understanding\\nThe training data can be categorized into two types. The pre-training data includes a large amount of\\nunlabeled speech, which is used to initialize the speech encoder in a self-supervised manner. The supervised\\nfinetuning data includes speech recognition, speech translation, and spoken dialogue data; this data is used to\\nunlock specific abilities when integrated with the large language model.\\nPre-training data. To pre-train the speech encoder, we curate a dataset of approximately 15M hours of speech\\nrecordings encompassing a large number of languages. We filter our audio data using a voice activity detection\\n(VAD) model and select audio samples with a VAD threshold above 0.7 for pre-training. In speech pre-training\\ndata, we also focus on ensuring the absence of PII. We use the Presidio Analyzer to identify such PII.\\nSpeech recognition and translation data. Our ASR training data contains 230K hours of manually transcribed\\nspeech recordings that span 34 languages. Our AST training data contains 90K hours of translations in\\ntwo directions: from 33 languages to English and from English to 33 languages. This data contains both\\nsupervised and synthetic data generated using the NLLB toolkit (NLLB Team et al., 2022). The use of\\nsynthetic AST data enables us to increase model quality for low-resource languages. The speech segments in\\nour data have a maximum length of 60 seconds.\\nSpoken dialogue data. To finetune the speech adapter for spoken dialogue, we synthetically generate responses\\n18The speech interface supports the following 34 languages: Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, Finnish, French,\\nGerman, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Malayalam, Marathi, Persian,\\nPolish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese.\\n63'),\n",

We used several heuristics to select a subset of finetuning\\ndata that matches the distribution of speech. These heuristics include focusing on relatively short prompts\\nwith a simple structure and without non-text symbols.\\n8.1.2 Speech Generation\\nThe speech generation datasets mainly consist of those for training the text normalization (TN) model and\\nthe prosody model (PM). Both training data are augmented with an additional input feature of the Llama 3\\nembeddings to provide contextual information.\\nText normalization data. Our TN training dataset includes 55K samples that cover a wide range of semiotic\\nclasses (e.g., number, date, time) that require non-trivial normalization. Each sample is a pair of written-form\\ntext and the corresponding normalized spoken-form text, with an inferred sequence of handcrafted TN rules\\nthat carry out the normalization.\\nProsody model data. The PM training data includes linguistic and prosodic features extracted from a 50K-hour\\nTTS dataset, which are paired transcripts and audios recorded by professional voice actors in studio settings.\\nLlama 3 embedding. The Llama 3 embeddings are taken as the output of the 16th decoder layer. We work\\nexclusively with the Llama 3 8B model and extract the embeddings for a given text (i.e. written-form input\\ntext for TN or the audio transcript for PM) as if they are generated by the Llama 3 model with an empty\\nuser prompt. In a given sample, each chunk in the Llama 3 token sequence is explicitly aligned with the\\ncorresponding chunks in native input sequence for TN or PM,i.e., TN-specific text tokens (demarcated by\\nunicode category) or phone-rate features respectively. This allows for training the TN and PM modules with\\nstreaming input of Llama 3 tokens and embeddings.\\n8.2 Model Architecture\\n8.2.1 Speech Understanding\\nOn the input side, the speech module consists of two successive modules: a speech encoder and an adapter.\\nThe output of the speech module is directly fed into the language model as token representation, enabling\\ndirect interaction between speech and text tokens. Furthermore, we incorporate two new special tokens\\nto enclose the sequence of speech representations. The speech module differs substantially from the vision\\nmodule (see Section 7), which feeds multi-modal information into the language model via cross-attention\\nlayers. By contrast, the speech module generates embeddings that can be seamlessly integrated with text\\ntokens, enabling the speech interface to leverage all the capabilities of the Llama 3 language model.\\nSpeech encoder. Our speech encoder is a Conformer (Gulati et al., 2020) model with 1B parameters. The\\ninput to the model consists of 80-dimensional mel-spectrogram features, which are first processed by a stride-4\\nstacking layer followed by a linear projection to reduce the frame length to 40 ms. The resulting features are\\nprocessed by an encoder with 24 Conformer layers. Each Conformer layer has a latent dimension of 1536,\\nand consists of two Macron-net style feed-forward networks with dimension 4096, a convolution module with\\nkernel size 7, and a rotary attention module (Su et al., 2024) with 24 attention heads.\\nSpeech adapter. The speech adapter contains about 100M parameters. It is composed of a convolution layer,\\na rotary Transformer layer, and a linear layer. The convolution layer has a kernel size of 3 and a stride of\\n2, which is designed to reduce the speech frame length to 80ms. This allows the model to provide more\\ncoarse-grained features to the language model. The Transformer layer has a latent dimension of 3072 and a\\nfeed-forward network with a dimension of 4096 which further processes the information from speech with\\ncontext after the convolutional downsampling. Finally, the linear layer maps the output dimension to match\\nthat of the language-model embedding layer.\\n64'),\n",

The TN module ensures semantic correctness by contextually transforming written text\\ninto spoken form. The PM module enhances naturalness and expressiveness by predicting prosodic features\\nusing these embeddings. Together, they enable accurate and natural speech generation.\\nText normalization. As a determinant of the semantic correctness of generated speech, the text normalization\\n(TN) module carries out context-aware transformation from written-form text into the respective spoken form\\nwhich is eventually verbalized by the downstream components. For example, the written-form text123 is\\nread as a cardinal number (one hundred twenty three) or spelled digit-by-digit (one two three) depending\\non the semantic context. The TN system consists of a streaming LSTM-based sequence-tagging model that\\npredicts the sequence of handcrafted TN rules used to transform the input text (Kang et al., 2024). The\\nneural model also takes in Llama 3 embeddings via cross attention to leverage the contextual information\\nencoded therein, enabling minimal text token lookahead and streaming input/output.\\nProsody modeling. To enhance the naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech, we integrate a\\ndecoder-only Transformer-based Prosody model (PM) (Radford et al., 2021) that takes the Llama 3 embeddings\\nas an additional input. This integration leverages the linguistic capabilities of Llama 3, utilizing both its\\ntextual output and intermediate embeddings at the token rate (Devlin et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2019; Raffel\\net al., 2020; Guo et al., 2023) to enhance the prediction of prosody features, thus reducing the lookahead\\nrequired by the model.\\nThe PM integrates several input components to generate comprehensive prosody predictions: linguistic features\\nderived from the text normalization front-end detailed above, tokens, and embeddings. The PM predicts three\\nkey prosodic features: log duration of each phone, log F0 (fundamental frequency) average, and log power\\naverage across the phone duration. The model comprises a uni-directional Transformer and six attention\\nheads. Each block includes cross-attention layers and dual fully connected layers with a hidden dimension\\nof 864. A distinctive feature of the PM is its dual cross-attention mechanism, with one layer dedicated to\\nlinguistic inputs and the other to Llama embeddings. This setup efficiently manages varying input rates\\nwithout requiring explicit alignment.\\n8.3 Training Recipe\\n8.3.1 Speech Understanding\\nTraining of the speech module is done in two stages. The first stage, speech pre-training, leverages unlabeled\\ndata to train a speech encoder that exhibits strong generalization capabilities across languages and acoustic\\nconditions. In the second stage, supervised fine-tuning, the adapter and pre-trained encoder are integrated\\nwith the language model, and trained jointly with it while the LLM stays frozen. This enables the model to\\nrespond to speech input. This stage uses labeled data corresponding to speech understanding abilities.\\nMultilingual ASR and AST modeling often results in language confusion/interference, which leads to degraded\\nperformance. A popular way to mitigate this is to incorporate language identification (LID) information,\\nboth on the source and target side. This can lead to improved performance in the predetermined set of\\ndirections, but it does come with potential loss of generality. For instance, if a translation system expects\\nLID on both source and target side, then the model will not likely to show good zero-shot performance in\\ndirections that were not seen in training. So our challenge is to design a system that allows LID information\\nto some extent, but keeps the model general enough such that we can have the model do speech translation\\nin unseen directions. To address this, we design system prompts which only contain LID for the text to be\\nemitted (target side). There is no LID information for the speech input (source side) in these prompts, which\\nalso potentially allows it to work with code-switched speech. For ASR, we use the following system prompt:\\nRepeat after me in {language}:, where{language} comes from one of the 34 languages (English, French,\\netc.) For speech translation, the system prompt is:Translate the following sentence into {language}:. This\\ndesign has been shown to be effective in prompting the language model to respond in the desired language.\\nWe used the same system prompts during training and inference.\\nSpeech pre-training.

This ensures consistent lookahead while\\nprocessing incoming text, which is crucial for low-latency speech synthesis applications.\\nTraining. We develop a dynamic alignment strategy utilizing causal masking to facilitate streamability in\\nspeech synthesis. This strategy incorporates a lookahead mechanism for a fixed number of future phones and a\\nvariable number of future tokens, aligning with the chunking process during text normalization (Section 8.1.2).\\nFor each phone, the token lookahead includes the maximum number of tokens defined by the chunk size,\\nresulting in variable lookahead for Llama embeddings but fixed lookahead for phonemes.\\nThe Llama 3 embeddings are sourced from the Llama 3 8B model, which remains frozen during the training\\nof the Prosody Model. The input phone-rate features include both linguistic and speaker/style controllability\\nelements. The model training is conducted with a batch size of 1,024 utterances, each with a maximum length\\nof 500 phones. We employ a learning rate of9 × 10−4 using the AdamW optimizer, training over 1 million\\nupdates with a learning rate warmup for the first 3,000 updates, following a cosine schedule.\\nInference. During inference, the same lookahead mechanism and causal masking strategy are employed to\\nensure consistency between training and real-time processing. The PM handles incoming text in a streaming\\nmanner, updating the input phone by phone for phone-rate features and chunk by chunk for token-rate\\nfeatures. The new chunk input is updated only when the first phone for that chunk is current, maintaining\\nthe alignment and lookahead as during training.\\nFor prosody target prediction, we employ a delayed pattern approach (Kharitonov et al., 2021), which enhances\\nthe model’s ability to capture and reproduce long-range prosodic dependencies. This approach contributes to\\nthe naturalness and expressiveness of the synthesized speech, ensuring low-latency and high-quality output.\\n8.4 Speech Understanding Results\\nWe evaluate the speech understanding capabilities of our speech interface for Llama 3 on three tasks:(1)\\nautomatic speech recognition,(2) speech translation, and(3) spoken question answering.

A comprehensive overview of that work is outside the scope of this paper; we\\nrefer the reader to Bordes et al. (2024); Madan et al. (2024); Zhao et al. (2023a) for such overviews. Below,\\nwe briefly outline seminal works that directly influenced the development of Llama 3.\\n9.1 Language\\nScale. Llama 3 follows the enduring trend of applying straightforward methods at ever increasing scales in\\nfoundation models. Improvements are driven by increased compute and improved data, with the 405B model\\nusing almost fifty times the pre-training compute budget of Llama 2 70B. Despite containing 405B parameters,\\nour largest Llama 3 in fact contains fewer parameters than earlier and much less performant models such as\\nPALM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), due to better understanding of scaling laws (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann\\net al., 2022). Little is publicly known about the size of other frontier models, such as Claude 3 or GPT\\n4 (OpenAI, 2023a), but overall performance is compareable.\\nSmall models. Developments in smaller models have paralleled those in large models. Models with fewer\\nparameters can dramatically improve inference cost and simplify deployment (Mehta et al., 2024; Team et al.,\\n2024). The smaller Llama 3 models achieve this by training far beyond the point of compute optimal training,\\neffectively trading training compute for inference efficiency. An alternative path is to distill larger models into\\nsmaller ones, as in Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\\nArchitectures. While Llama 3 makes minimal architectural modifiations to compared to Llama 2, other recent\\nfoundation models have explored other designs. Most notably, mixture of experts architectures (Shazeer et al.,\\n2017; Lewis et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) can be used as an efficient way to increase\\nthe capacity of a models, such as in Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) and Arctic (Snowflake, 2024). Llama 3\\noutperforms these models, suggesting that dense architectures are not the limiting factor, but there remain\\nnumerous trade offs in terms of training and inference efficiency, and model stability at scale.\\nOpen source. Open weights foundation models have rapidly improved over the last year, with Llama3-405B\\nnow competitive with the current closed weight state-of-the-art. Numerous model families have recently been\\ndeveloped, including Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023), MPT (Databricks, 2024),\\nPythia (Biderman et al., 2023), Arctic (Snowflake, 2024), OpenELM (Mehta et al., 2024), OLMo (Groeneveld\\net al., 2024), StableLM (Bellagente et al., 2024), OpenLLaMA (Geng and Liu, 2023), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023),\\nGemma (Team et al., 2024), Grok (XAI, 2024), and Phi (Abdin et al., 2024).\\nPost-training. Post-training Llama 3 follows the established strategy of instruction tuning (Chung et al., 2022;\\nOuyang et al., 2022) followed by alignment with human feedback (Kaufmann et al., 2023). While some studies\\nhave shown the surprising effectiveness of lightweight alignment procedures (Zhou et al., 2024), Llama 3\\nuses millions of human instructions and preference judgments to improve the pre-trained model, including\\n69'),\n",

In order to curate these instruction and preference examples,\\nwe deploy earlier versions of Llama 3 to filter (Liu et al., 2024c), re-write (Pan et al., 2024), or generate\\nprompts and responses (Liu et al., 2024b) and apply these techniques through multiple rounds of post-training.\\n9.2 Multimodality\\nOur experiments with multimodal capabilities for Llama 3 are part of a long line of work on foundation\\nmodels that jointly model multiple modalities.\\nImages. A substantial body of work has trained image-recognition models on large amounts of image-text\\npairs, for example, Mahajan et al. (2018); Xiao et al. (2024a); Team (2024); OpenAI (2023b). Radford et al.\\n(2021) presented one of the first models to jointly embed images and text via contrastive learning. More\\nrecently, a series of models has studied approaches similar to the one used in Llama 3, for example, Alayrac\\net al. (2022); Dai et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023c,b); Yang et al. (2023b); Ye et al. (2023); Zhu et al. (2023).\\nOur approach in Llama 3 combines ideas from many of these papers to achieve results that are comparable\\nwith Gemini 1.0 Ultra (Google, 2023) and GPT-4 Vision (OpenAI, 2023b); see Section 7.6.\\nVideo. Although video inputs are supported by an increasing number of foundation models (Google, 2023;\\nOpenAI, 2023b), the body of work on joint modeling of videos and language is not that large. Akin to Llama\\n3, most current studies adopt an adapter approach to align video and language representations and unlock\\nquestion-answering and reasoning about videos (Lin et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a; Maaz et al., 2024; Zhang\\net al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2022). We find that such approaches produce results that are competitive with the\\nstate-of-the-art; see Section 7.7.\\nSpeech. Our work also fits in a larger body of work combining language and speech modeling. Earlier joint\\nmodels of text and speech include AudioPaLM (Rubenstein et al., 2023), VioLA (Wang et al., 2023b), VoxtLM\\nMaiti et al. (2023), SUTLM (Chou et al., 2023), and Spirit-LM (Nguyen et al., 2024). Our work builds\\non prior compositional approaches to combining speech and language like Fathullah et al. (2024). Unlike\\nmost prior work, we opt to not finetune the language model itself for speech tasks as doing so may lead to\\ncontention on non-speech tasks. We find that at larger model scales, strong performances are attainable even\\nwithout such finetuning; see Section 8.4.\\n10 Conclusion\\nIn many ways, the development of high-quality foundation models is still in its infancy. Our experience\\nin developing Llama 3 suggests that substantial further improvements of these models are on the horizon.\\nThroughout the development of the Llama 3 model family, we found that a strong focus on high-quality data,\\nscale, and simplicity consistently yielded the best results. In preliminary experiments, we explored more\\ncomplex model architectures and training recipes but did not find the benefits of such approaches to outweigh\\nthe additional complexity they introduce in model development.\\nDeveloping a flagship foundation model such as Llama 3 involves overcoming a plethora of deep technical\\nproblems but also requires clever organizational decisions. For example, to ensure Llama 3 is not accidentally\\noverfitted on commonly used benchmarks, our pre-training data was procured and processed by a separate team\\nthat was strongly incentivized to prevent contamination of that pre-training data with external benchmarks.\\nAs another example, we ensure that our human evaluations remain trustworthy by allowing only a small set\\nof researchers who do not contribute to model development to perform and access these evaluations. While\\nsuch organizational decisions are rarely discussed in technical papers, we found them to be pivotal to the\\nsuccessful development of the Llama 3 family of models.\\nWe shared the details of our development process because we believe this will:(1) help the larger research\\ncommunity understand the key factors of foundation model development and(2) contribute to a more informed\\ndebate about the future of foundation models in the general public. We also shared preliminary experiments\\nwith integrating multimodal capabilities into Llama 3. While these models are still under active development\\nand not yet ready for release, we hope sharing our results early will accelerate research in this direction.\\n70'),\n",

To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective\\ntraining, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architec-\\ntures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers\\nan auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training\\nobjective for stronger performance. We pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and\\nhigh-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to\\nfully harness its capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms\\nother open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source\\nmodels.

Introduction\\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and\\nevolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap to-\\nwards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Beyond closed-source models, open-source models,\\nincluding DeepSeek series (DeepSeek-AI, 2024a,b,c; Guo et al., 2024), LLaMA series (AI@Meta,\\n2024a,b; Touvron et al., 2023a,b), Qwen series (Qwen, 2023, 2024a,b), and Mistral series (Jiang\\net al., 2023; Mistral, 2024), are also making significant strides, endeavoring to close the gap with\\ntheir closed-source counterparts. To further push the boundaries of open-source model capa-\\nbilities, we scale up our models and introduce DeepSeek-V3, a large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\\nmodel with 671B parameters, of which 37B are activated for each token.\\nWith a forward-looking perspective, we consistently strive for strong model performance\\nand economical costs. Therefore, in terms of architecture, DeepSeek-V3 still adopts Multi-head\\nLatent Attention (MLA) (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c) for efficient inference and DeepSeekMoE (Dai\\net al., 2024) for cost-effective training. These two architectures have been validated in DeepSeek-\\nV2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024c), demonstrating their capability to maintain robust model performance\\nwhile achieving efficient training and inference. Beyond the basic architecture, we implement\\ntwo additional strategies to further enhance the model capabilities. Firstly, DeepSeek-V3 pi-\\noneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy (Wang et al., 2024a) for load balancing, with the aim of\\nminimizing the adverse impact on model performance that arises from the effort to encourage\\nload balancing. Secondly, DeepSeek-V3 employs a multi-token prediction training objective,\\nwhich we have observed to enhance the overall performance on evaluation benchmarks.\\nIn order to achieve efficient training, we support the FP8 mixed precision training and\\nimplement comprehensive optimizations for the training framework. Low-precision training\\nhas emerged as a promising solution for efficient training (Dettmers et al., 2022; Kalamkar et al.,\\n2019; Narang et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2023b), its evolution being closely tied to advancements in\\nhardware capabilities (Luo et al., 2024; Micikevicius et al., 2022; Rouhani et al., 2023a). In this\\nwork, we introduce an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate\\nits effectiveness on an extremely large-scale model. Through the support for FP8 computation\\nand storage, we achieve both accelerated training and reduced GPU memory usage. As for\\nthe training framework, we design the DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism,\\nwhich has fewer pipeline bubbles and hides most of the communication during training through\\ncomputation-communication overlap. This overlap ensures that, as the model further scales up,\\nas long as we maintain a constant computation-to-communication ratio, we can still employ\\nfine-grained experts across nodes while achieving a near-zero all-to-all communication overhead.\\nIn addition, we also develop efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels to fully utilize\\nInfiniBand (IB) and NVLink bandwidths. Furthermore, we meticulously optimize the memory\\nfootprint, making it possible to train DeepSeek-V3 without using costly tensor parallelism.\\nCombining these efforts, we achieve high training efficiency.\\nDuring pre-training, we train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T high-quality and diverse tokens. The\\npre-training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not\\nencounter any irrecoverable loss spikes or have to roll back. Next, we conduct a two-stage\\ncontext length extension for DeepSeek-V3. In the first stage, the maximum context length is\\nextended to 32K, and in the second stage, it is further extended to 128K. Following this, we\\nconduct post-training, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)\\non the base model of DeepSeek-V3, to align it with human preferences and further unlock its\\npotential. During the post-training stage, we distill the reasoning capability from the DeepSeek-\\nR1 series of models, and meanwhile carefully maintain the balance between model accuracy\\n4'),\n",

Consequently, our pre-\\ntraining stage is completed in less than two months and costs 2664K GPU hours. Combined\\nwith 119K GPU hours for the context length extension and 5K GPU hours for post-training,\\nDeepSeek-V3 costs only 2.788M GPU hours for its full training. Assuming the rental price of\\nthe H800 GPU is $2 per GPU hour, our total training costs amount to only $5.576M. Note that\\nthe aforementioned costs include only the official training of DeepSeek-V3, excluding the costs\\nassociated with prior research and ablation experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data.\\nOur main contribution includes:\\nArchitecture: Innovative Load Balancing Strategy and Training Objective\\n• On top of the efficient architecture of DeepSeek-V2, we pioneer an auxiliary-loss-free\\nstrategy for load balancing, which minimizes the performance degradation that arises\\nfrom encouraging load balancing.\\n• We investigate a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective and prove it beneficial to model\\nperformance. It can also be used for speculative decoding for inference acceleration.\\nPre-Training: Towards Ultimate Training Efficiency\\n• We design an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate the\\nfeasibility and effectiveness of FP8 training on an extremely large-scale model.\\n• Through the co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware, we overcome the\\ncommunication bottleneck in cross-node MoE training, achieving near-full computation-\\ncommunication overlap. This significantly enhances our training efficiency and reduces the\\ntraining costs, enabling us to further scale up the model size without additional overhead.\\n• At an economical cost of only 2.664M H800 GPU hours, we complete the pre-training of\\nDeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T tokens, producing the currently strongest open-source base model.\\nThe subsequent training stages after pre-training require only 0.1M GPU hours.\\nPost-Training: Knowledge Distillation from DeepSeek-R1\\n• We introduce an innovative methodology to distill reasoning capabilities from the long-\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) model, specifically from one of the DeepSeek R1 series models,\\ninto standard LLMs, particularly DeepSeek-V3.

Slightly different from DeepSeek-V2, DeepSeek-V3 uses the sigmoid function\\nto compute the affinity scores, and applies a normalization among all selected affinity scores to\\nproduce the gating values.\\nAuxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing. For MoE models, an unbalanced expert load will lead to\\nrouting collapse (Shazeer et al., 2017) and diminish computational efficiency in scenarios with\\nexpert parallelism. Conventional solutions usually rely on the auxiliary loss (Fedus et al., 2021;\\nLepikhin et al., 2021) to avoid unbalanced load. However, too large an auxiliary loss will impair\\nthe model performance (Wang et al., 2024a). To achieve a better trade-off between load balance\\nand model performance, we pioneer an auxiliary-loss-free load balancing strategy (Wang et al.,\\n2024a) to ensure load balance. To be specific, we introduce a bias term 𝑏𝑖 for each expert and\\nadd it to the corresponding affinity scores 𝑠𝑖,𝑡 to determine the top-K routing:\\n𝑔′\\n𝑖,𝑡 =\\n(\\n𝑠𝑖,𝑡, 𝑠𝑖,𝑡 +𝑏𝑖 ∈Topk({𝑠𝑗,𝑡 +𝑏𝑗|1 ⩽ 𝑗 ⩽ 𝑁𝑟}, 𝐾𝑟),\\n0, otherwise. (16)\\nNote that the bias term is only used for routing. The gating value, which will be multiplied with\\nthe FFN output, is still derived from the original affinity score 𝑠𝑖,𝑡. During training, we keep\\nmonitoring the expert load on the whole batch of each training step. At the end of each step,\\nwe will decrease the bias term by 𝛾if its corresponding expert is overloaded, and increase it by\\n𝛾if its corresponding expert is underloaded, where 𝛾is a hyper-parameter called bias update\\nspeed. Through the dynamic adjustment, DeepSeek-V3 keeps balanced expert load during\\ntraining, and achieves better performance than models that encourage load balance through\\npure auxiliary losses.\\nComplementary Sequence-Wise Auxiliary Loss. Although DeepSeek-V3 mainly relies on the\\nauxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balance, to prevent extreme imbalance within any single\\nsequence, we also employ a complementary sequence-wise balance loss:\\nLBal = 𝛼\\n𝑁𝑟∑︁\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑓𝑖𝑃𝑖, (17)\\n𝑓𝑖 = 𝑁𝑟\\n𝐾𝑟𝑇\\n𝑇∑︁\\n𝑡=1\\n1 \\x00\\n𝑠𝑖,𝑡 ∈Topk({𝑠𝑗,𝑡|1 ⩽ 𝑗 ⩽ 𝑁𝑟}, 𝐾𝑟)\\x01 , (18)\\n𝑠′\\n𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑠𝑖,𝑡\\nÍ𝑁𝑟\\n𝑗=1 𝑠𝑗,𝑡\\n, (19)\\n𝑃𝑖 = 1\\n𝑇\\n𝑇∑︁\\n𝑡=1\\n𝑠′\\n𝑖,𝑡, (20)\\nwhere the balance factor 𝛼 is a hyper-parameter, which will be assigned an extremely small\\nvalue for DeepSeek-V3; 1(·)denotes the indicator function; and 𝑇 denotes the number of tokens\\nin a sequence. The sequence-wise balance loss encourages the expert load on each sequence to\\nbe balanced.\\n9'),\n",

For\\nthe 𝑖-th input token 𝑡𝑖, at the 𝑘-th prediction depth, we first combine the representation of the𝑖-th\\ntoken at the (𝑘−1)-th depth h𝑘−1\\n𝑖 ∈R𝑑 and the embedding of the (𝑖+𝑘)-th token 𝐸𝑚𝑏(𝑡𝑖+𝑘)∈ R𝑑\\n10'),\n",

Both all-to-all and PP communication can be fully hidden.\\n3.2. Training Framework\\nThe training of DeepSeek-V3 is supported by the HAI-LLM framework, an efficient and\\nlightweight training framework crafted by our engineers from the ground up. On the whole,\\nDeepSeek-V3 applies 16-way Pipeline Parallelism (PP) (Qi et al., 2023a), 64-way Expert Paral-\\nlelism (EP) (Lepikhin et al., 2021) spanning 8 nodes, and ZeRO-1 Data Parallelism (DP) (Rajb-\\nhandari et al., 2020).\\nIn order to facilitate efficient training of DeepSeek-V3, we implement meticulous engineering\\noptimizations. Firstly, we design the DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism.\\nCompared with existing PP methods, DualPipe has fewer pipeline bubbles. More importantly, it\\noverlaps the computation and communication phases across forward and backward processes,\\nthereby addressing the challenge of heavy communication overhead introduced by cross-node\\nexpert parallelism. Secondly, we develop efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels\\nto fully utilize IB and NVLink bandwidths and conserve Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)\\ndedicated to communication. Finally, we meticulously optimize the memory footprint during\\ntraining, thereby enabling us to train DeepSeek-V3 without using costly Tensor Parallelism (TP).\\n3.2.1. DualPipe and Computation-Communication Overlap\\nFor DeepSeek-V3, the communication overhead introduced by cross-node expert parallelism\\nresults in an inefficient computation-to-communication ratio of approximately 1:1. To tackle this\\nchallenge, we design an innovative pipeline parallelism algorithm called DualPipe, which not\\nonly accelerates model training by effectively overlapping forward and backward computation-\\ncommunication phases, but also reduces the pipeline bubbles.\\nThe key idea of DualPipe is to overlap the computation and communication within a pair of\\nindividual forward and backward chunks. To be specific, we divide each chunk into four compo-\\nnents: attention, all-to-all dispatch, MLP, and all-to-all combine. Specially, for\\na backward chunk, both attention and MLP are further split into two parts, backward for\\ninput and backward for weights, like in ZeroBubble (Qi et al., 2023b). In addition, we\\nhave a PP communication component. As illustrated in Figure 4, for a pair of forward and\\nbackward chunks, we rearrange these components and manually adjust the ratio of GPU SMs\\ndedicated to communication versus computation. In this overlapping strategy, we can ensure\\nthat both all-to-all and PP communication can be fully hidden during execution. Given the\\nefficient overlapping strategy, the full DualPipe scheduling is illustrated in Figure 5. It employs\\na bidirectional pipeline scheduling, which feeds micro-batches from both ends of the pipeline\\nsimultaneously and a significant portion of communications can be fully overlapped. This\\noverlap also ensures that, as the model further scales up, as long as we maintain a constant\\ncomputation-to-communication ratio, we can still employ fine-grained experts across nodes\\nwhile achieving a near-zero all-to-all communication overhead.\\n12'),\n",

In addition, for DualPipe,\\nneither the bubbles nor activation memory will increase as the number of micro-batches grows.\\n3.2.2. Efficient Implementation of Cross-Node All-to-All Communication\\nIn order to ensure sufficient computational performance for DualPipe, we customize efficient\\ncross-node all-to-all communication kernels (including dispatching and combining) to conserve\\nthe number of SMs dedicated to communication. The implementation of the kernels is co-\\ndesigned with the MoE gating algorithm and the network topology of our cluster. To be specific,\\nin our cluster, cross-node GPUs are fully interconnected with IB, and intra-node communications\\nare handled via NVLink. NVLink offers a bandwidth of 160 GB/s, roughly 3.2 times that of IB\\n(50 GB/s). To effectively leverage the different bandwidths of IB and NVLink, we limit each\\ntoken to be dispatched to at most 4 nodes, thereby reducing IB traffic. For each token, when its\\nrouting decision is made, it will first be transmitted via IB to the GPUs with the same in-node\\nindex on its target nodes. Once it reaches the target nodes, we will endeavor to ensure that it is\\ninstantaneously forwarded via NVLink to specific GPUs that host their target experts, without\\nbeing blocked by subsequently arriving tokens. In this way, communications via IB and NVLink\\nare fully overlapped, and each token can efficiently select an average of 3.2 experts per node\\nwithout incurring additional overhead from NVLink.

With a minor overhead, this strategy significantly\\nreduces memory requirements for storing activations.\\nExponential Moving Average in CPU. During training, we preserve the Exponential Mov-\\ning Average (EMA) of the model parameters for early estimation of the model performance\\nafter learning rate decay. The EMA parameters are stored in CPU memory and are updated\\nasynchronously after each training step.

With the DualPipe strategy,\\nwe deploy the shallowest layers (including the embedding layer) and deepest layers (including\\nthe output head) of the model on the same PP rank.

FP8 Training\\nInspired by recent advances in low-precision training (Dettmers et al., 2022; Noune et al., 2022;\\nPeng et al., 2023b), we propose a fine-grained mixed precision framework utilizing the FP8\\ndata format for training DeepSeek-V3. While low-precision training holds great promise, it\\nis often limited by the presence of outliers in activations, weights, and gradients (Fishman\\net al., 2024; He et al.; Sun et al., 2024). Although significant progress has been made in in-\\nference quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023), there are relatively few studies\\ndemonstrating successful application of low-precision techniques in large-scale language model\\n14'),\n",

To address this challenge and effectively extend the dynamic\\nrange of the FP8 format, we introduce a fine-grained quantization strategy: tile-wise grouping\\nwith 1 ×𝑁𝑐 elements or block-wise grouping with 𝑁𝑐 ×𝑁𝑐 elements. The associated dequantiza-\\ntion overhead is largely mitigated under our increased-precision accumulation process, a critical\\naspect for achieving accurate FP8 General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM). Moreover, to further\\nreduce memory and communication overhead in MoE training, we cache and dispatch activa-\\ntions in FP8, while storing low-precision optimizer states in BF16. We validate the proposed FP8\\nmixed precision framework on two model scales similar to DeepSeek-V2-Lite and DeepSeek-\\nV2, training for approximately 1 trillion tokens (see more details in Appendix B.1). Notably,\\ncompared with the BF16 baseline, the relative loss error of our FP8-training model remains\\nconsistently below 0.25%, a level well within the acceptable range of training randomness.\\n3.3.1. Mixed Precision Framework\\nBuilding upon widely adopted techniques in low-precision training (Kalamkar et al., 2019;\\nNarang et al., 2017), we propose a mixed precision framework for FP8 training. In this frame-\\nwork, most compute-density operations are conducted in FP8, while a few key operations\\nare strategically maintained in their original data formats to balance training efficiency and\\nnumerical stability. The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 6.\\nFirstly, in order to accelerate model training, the majority of core computation kernels, i.e.,\\nGEMM operations, are implemented in FP8 precision. These GEMM operations accept FP8\\ntensors as inputs and produce outputs in BF16 or FP32. As depicted in Figure 6, all three GEMMs\\nassociated with theLinear operator, namelyFprop (forward pass), Dgrad (activation backward\\npass), and Wgrad (weight backward pass), are executed in FP8. This design theoretically doubles\\nthe computational speed compared with the original BF16 method. Additionally, the FP8 Wgrad\\nGEMM allows activations to be stored in FP8 for use in the backward pass. This significantly\\nreduces memory consumption.\\nDespite the efficiency advantage of the FP8 format, certain operators still require a higher\\nprecision due to their sensitivity to low-precision computations. Besides, some low-cost opera-\\ntors can also utilize a higher precision with a negligible overhead to the overall training cost. For\\nthis reason, after careful investigations, we maintain the original precision (e.g., BF16 or FP32)\\nfor the following components: the embedding module, the output head, MoE gating modules,\\nnormalization operators, and attention operators. These targeted retentions of high precision\\nensure stable training dynamics for DeepSeek-V3. To further guarantee numerical stability, we\\nstore the master weights, weight gradients, and optimizer states in higher precision. While\\n15'),\n",

Improved Precision from Quantization and Multiplication\\nBased on our mixed precision FP8 framework, we introduce several strategies to enhance low-\\nprecision training accuracy, focusing on both the quantization method and the multiplication\\nprocess.\\nFine-Grained Quantization. In low-precision training frameworks, overflows and underflows\\nare common challenges due to the limited dynamic range of the FP8 format, which is constrained\\nby its reduced exponent bits. As a standard practice, the input distribution is aligned to the\\nrepresentable range of the FP8 format by scaling the maximum absolute value of the input\\ntensor to the maximum representable value of FP8 (Narang et al., 2017). This method makes low-\\nprecision training highly sensitive to activation outliers, which can heavily degrade quantization\\naccuracy. To solve this, we propose a fine-grained quantization method that applies scaling\\nat a more granular level. As illustrated in Figure 7 (a), (1) for activations, we group and\\nscale elements on a 1x128 tile basis (i.e., per token per 128 channels); and (2) for weights, we\\ngroup and scale elements on a 128x128 block basis (i.e., per 128 input channels per 128 output\\nchannels). This approach ensures that the quantization process can better accommodate outliers\\nby adapting the scale according to smaller groups of elements. In Appendix B.2, we further\\ndiscuss the training instability when we group and scale activations on a block basis in the same\\nway as weights quantization.\\nOne key modification in our method is the introduction of per-group scaling factors along\\nthe inner dimension of GEMM operations. This functionality is not directly supported in the\\nstandard FP8 GEMM. However, combined with our precise FP32 accumulation strategy, it can\\n16'),\n",

We hope our design can serve as a reference for\\nfuture work to keep pace with the latest GPU architectures.\\nIncreasing Accumulation Precision. Low-precision GEMM operations often suffer from un-\\nderflow issues, and their accuracy largely depends on high-precision accumulation, which is\\ncommonly performed in an FP32 precision (Kalamkar et al., 2019; Narang et al., 2017). However,\\nwe observe that the accumulation precision of FP8 GEMM on NVIDIA H800 GPUs is limited to\\nretaining around 14 bits, which is significantly lower than FP32 accumulation precision. This\\nproblem will become more pronounced when the inner dimension K is large (Wortsman et al.,\\n2023), a typical scenario in large-scale model training where the batch size and model width\\nare increased. Taking GEMM operations of two random matrices with K = 4096 for example, in\\nour preliminary test, the limited accumulation precision in Tensor Cores results in a maximum\\nrelative error of nearly 2%. Despite these problems, the limited accumulation precision is still\\nthe default option in a few FP8 frameworks (NVIDIA, 2024b), severely constraining the training\\naccuracy.\\nIn order to address this issue, we adopt the strategy of promotion to CUDA Cores for\\nhigher precision (Thakkar et al., 2023). The process is illustrated in Figure 7 (b). To be specific,\\nduring MMA (Matrix Multiply-Accumulate) execution on Tensor Cores, intermediate results\\nare accumulated using the limited bit width. Once an interval of 𝑁𝐶 is reached, these partial\\nresults will be copied to FP32 registers on CUDA Cores, where full-precision FP32 accumulation\\nis performed. As mentioned before, our fine-grained quantization applies per-group scaling\\nfactors along the inner dimension K. These scaling factors can be efficiently multiplied on the\\nCUDA Cores as the dequantization process with minimal additional computational cost.\\nIt is worth noting that this modification reduces the WGMMA (Warpgroup-level Matrix\\nMultiply-Accumulate) instruction issue rate for a single warpgroup. However, on the H800\\narchitecture, it is typical for two WGMMA to persist concurrently: while one warpgroup\\nperforms the promotion operation, the other is able to execute the MMA operation. This design\\nenables overlapping of the two operations, maintaining high utilization of Tensor Cores. Based\\non our experiments, setting 𝑁𝐶 = 128 elements, equivalent to 4 WGMMAs, represents the\\nminimal accumulation interval that can significantly improve precision without introducing\\nsubstantial overhead.\\nMantissa over Exponents.

Low-Precision Storage and Communication\\nIn conjunction with our FP8 training framework, we further reduce the memory consumption\\nand communication overhead by compressing cached activations and optimizer states into\\nlower-precision formats.\\nLow-Precision Optimizer States. We adopt the BF16 data format instead of FP32 to track the\\nfirst and second moments in the AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) optimizer, without\\nincurring observable performance degradation.

As illustrated in Figure 6, the Wgrad operation is performed in FP8.\\nTo reduce the memory consumption, it is a natural choice to cache activations in FP8 format\\nfor the backward pass of the Linear operator. However, special considerations are taken on\\nseveral operators for low-cost high-precision training:\\n(1) Inputs of the Linear after the attention operator. These activations are also\\nused in the backward pass of the attention operator, which makes it sensitive to\\nprecision. We adopt a customized E5M6 data format exclusively for these activations.\\nAdditionally, these activations will be converted from an 1x128 quantization tile to\\nan 128x1 tile in the backward pass. To avoid introducing extra quantization error,\\nall the scaling factors are round scaled, i.e., integral power of 2.\\n(2) Inputs of the SwiGLU operator in MoE. To further reduce the memory cost, we\\ncache the inputs of the SwiGLU operator and recompute its output in the backward\\npass. These activations are also stored in FP8 with our fine-grained quantization\\nmethod, striking a balance between memory efficiency and computational accuracy.\\nLow-Precision Communication. Communication bandwidth is a critical bottleneck in the\\ntraining of MoE models. To alleviate this challenge, we quantize the activation before MoE\\nup-projections into FP8 and then apply dispatch components, which is compatible with\\nFP8 Fprop in MoE up-projections. Like the inputs of the Linear after the attention operator,\\nscaling factors for this activation are integral power of 2. A similar strategy is applied to the\\nactivation gradient before MoE down-projections.

Its small TP size of 4 limits the overhead of TP\\ncommunication. For the MoE part, we use 32-way Expert Parallelism (EP32), which ensures that\\neach expert processes a sufficiently large batch size, thereby enhancing computational efficiency.\\nFor the MoE all-to-all communication, we use the same method as in training: first transferring\\ntokens across nodes via IB, and then forwarding among the intra-node GPUs via NVLink. In\\nparticular, we use 1-way Tensor Parallelism for the dense MLPs in shallow layers to save TP\\ncommunication.\\nTo achieve load balancing among different experts in theMoE part, we need to ensure that\\neach GPU processes approximately the same number of tokens. To this end, we introduce a\\ndeployment strategy of redundant experts, which duplicates high-load experts and deploys them\\nredundantly. The high-load experts are detected based on statistics collected during the online\\ndeployment and are adjusted periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes). After determining the set\\nof redundant experts, we carefully rearrange experts among GPUs within a node based on the\\nobserved loads, striving to balance the load across GPUs as much as possible without increasing\\nthe cross-node all-to-all communication overhead. For the deployment of DeepSeek-V3, we set\\n32 redundant experts for the prefilling stage. For each GPU, besides the original 8 experts it\\nhosts, it will also host one additional redundant expert.\\nFurthermore, in the prefilling stage, to improve the throughput and hide the overhead of\\nall-to-all and TP communication, we simultaneously process two micro-batches with similar\\ncomputational workloads, overlapping the attention and MoE of one micro-batch with the\\ndispatch and combine of another.\\nFinally, we are exploring adynamic redundancy strategy for experts, where each GPU hosts\\nmore experts (e.g., 16 experts), but only 9 will be activated during each inference step.

Suggestions on Hardware Design\\nBased on our implementation of the all-to-all communication and FP8 training scheme, we\\npropose the following suggestions on chip design to AI hardware vendors.\\n3.5.1. Communication Hardware\\nIn DeepSeek-V3, we implement the overlap between computation and communication to hide\\nthe communication latency during computation. This significantly reduces the dependency\\non communication bandwidth compared to serial computation and communication. However,\\nthe current communication implementation relies on expensive SMs (e.g., we allocate 20 out of\\nthe 132 SMs available in the H800 GPU for this purpose), which will limit the computational\\nthroughput. Moreover, using SMs for communication results in significant inefficiencies, as\\ntensor cores remain entirely under-utilized.\\nCurrently, the SMs primarily perform the following tasks for all-to-all communication:\\n• Forwarding data between the IB (InfiniBand) and NVLink domain while aggregating IB\\ntraffic destined for multiple GPUs within the same node from a single GPU.\\n• Transporting data between RDMA buffers (registered GPU memory regions) and in-\\nput/output buffers.\\n• Executing reduce operations for all-to-all combine.\\n• Managing fine-grained memory layout during chunked data transferring to multiple\\nexperts across the IB and NVLink domain.\\nWe aspire to see future vendors developing hardware that offloads these communication\\ntasks from the valuable computation unit SM, serving as a GPU co-processor or a network\\nco-processor like NVIDIA SHARP Graham et al. (2016). Furthermore, to reduce application\\nprogramming complexity, we aim for this hardware to unify the IB (scale-out) and NVLink\\n(scale-up) networks from the perspective of the computation units. With this unified interface,\\ncomputation units can easily accomplish operations such as read, write, multicast, and\\nreduce across the entire IB-NVLink-unified domain via submitting communication requests\\nbased on simple primitives.\\n3.5.2.

In the current Tensor Core\\nimplementation of the NVIDIA Hopper architecture, FP8 GEMM suffers from limited accumula-\\ntion precision.

Our implementation partially mitigates the limitation by accumulating\\nthe addition results of 128 FP8 ×FP8 multiplications into registers with FP32 precision in the\\nCUDA core. Although helpful in achieving successful FP8 training, it is merely a compromise\\ndue to the Hopper architecture’s hardware deficiency in FP8 GEMM accumulation precision.\\nFuture chips need to adopt higher precision.\\nSupport for Tile- and Block-Wise Quantization. Current GPUs only support per-tensor\\nquantization, lacking the native support for fine-grained quantization like our tile- and block-\\nwise quantization. In the current implementation, when the 𝑁𝐶 interval is reached, the partial\\nresults will be copied from Tensor Cores to CUDA cores, multiplied by the scaling factors, and\\nadded to FP32 registers on CUDA cores. Although the dequantization overhead is significantly\\nmitigated combined with our precise FP32 accumulation strategy, the frequent data movements\\nbetween Tensor Cores and CUDA cores still limit the computational efficiency. Therefore, we\\nrecommend future chips to support fine-grained quantization by enabling Tensor Cores to\\nreceive scaling factors and implement MMA with group scaling. In this way, the whole partial\\nsum accumulation and dequantization can be completed directly inside Tensor Cores until the\\nfinal result is produced, avoiding frequent data movements.\\nSupport for Online Quantization. The current implementations struggle to effectively support\\nonline quantization, despite its effectiveness demonstrated in our research. In the existing\\nprocess, we need to read 128 BF16 activation values (the output of the previous computation)\\nfrom HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for quantization, and the quantized FP8 values are\\nthen written back to HBM, only to be read again for MMA. To address this inefficiency, we\\nrecommend that future chips integrate FP8 cast and TMA (Tensor Memory Accelerator) access\\ninto a single fused operation, so quantization can be completed during the transfer of activations\\nfrom global memory to shared memory, avoiding frequent memory reads and writes. We also\\nrecommend supporting a warp-level cast instruction for speedup, which further facilitates the\\nbetter fusion of layer normalization and FP8 cast. Alternatively, a near-memory computing\\napproach can be adopted, where compute logic is placed near the HBM. In this case, BF16\\nelements can be cast to FP8 directly as they are read from HBM into the GPU, reducing off-chip\\nmemory access by roughly 50%.\\nSupport for Transposed GEMM Operations. The current architecture makes it cumbersome\\nto fuse matrix transposition with GEMM operations. In our workflow, activations during the\\nforward pass are quantized into 1x128 FP8 tiles and stored. During the backward pass, the\\nmatrix needs to be read out, dequantized, transposed, re-quantized into 128x1 tiles, and stored\\nin HBM. To reduce memory operations, we recommend future chips to enable direct transposed\\nreads of matrices from shared memory before MMA operation, for those precisions required\\nin both training and inference. Combined with the fusion of FP8 format conversion and TMA\\naccess, this enhancement will significantly streamline the quantization workflow.\\n4. Pre-Training\\n4.1.

However,\\nthis trick may introduce the token boundary bias (Lundberg, 2023) when the model processes\\nmulti-line prompts without terminal line breaks, particularly for few-shot evaluation prompts.\\nTo address this issue, we randomly split a certain proportion of such combined tokens during\\ntraining, which exposes the model to a wider array of special cases and mitigates this bias.\\n4.2. Hyper-Parameters\\nModel Hyper-Parameters. We set the number of Transformer layers to 61 and the hidden\\ndimension to 7168. All learnable parameters are randomly initialized with a standard deviation\\nof 0.006. In MLA, we set the number of attention heads 𝑛ℎ to 128 and the per-head dimension 𝑑ℎ\\nto 128. The KV compression dimension 𝑑𝑐 is set to 512, and the query compression dimension 𝑑′\\n𝑐\\nis set to 1536. For the decoupled queries and key, we set the per-head dimension 𝑑𝑅\\nℎ to 64. We\\nsubstitute all FFNs except for the first three layers with MoE layers. Each MoE layer consists of 1\\nshared expert and 256 routed experts, where the intermediate hidden dimension of each expert\\nis 2048. Among the routed experts, 8 experts will be activated for each token, and each token\\nwill be ensured to be sent to at most 4 nodes. The multi-token prediction depth 𝐷is set to 1, i.e.,\\nbesides the exact next token, each token will predict one additional token. As DeepSeek-V2,\\nDeepSeek-V3 also employs additional RMSNorm layers after the compressed latent vectors,\\nand multiplies additional scaling factors at the width bottlenecks. Under this configuration,\\nDeepSeek-V3 comprises 671B total parameters, of which 37B are activated for each token.\\nTraining Hyper-Parameters. We employ the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017)\\nwith hyper-parameters set to 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.95, and weight_decay = 0.1. We set the maximum\\nsequence length to 4K during pre-training, and pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T tokens. As for\\nthe learning rate scheduling, we first linearly increase it from 0 to 2.2 ×10−4 during the first\\n2K steps. Then, we keep a constant learning rate of 2.2 ×10−4 until the model consumes 10T\\ntraining tokens. Subsequently, we gradually decay the learning rate to 2.2 ×10−5 in 4.3T tokens,\\nfollowing a cosine decay curve. During the training of the final 500B tokens, we keep a constant\\nlearning rate of 2.2 ×10−5 in the first 333B tokens, and switch to another constant learning rate\\n22'),\n",

Sequence-Wise Load Balance\\nThe key distinction between auxiliary-loss-free balancing and sequence-wise auxiliary loss lies\\nin their balancing scope: batch-wise versus sequence-wise. Compared with the sequence-wise\\nauxiliary loss, batch-wise balancing imposes a more flexible constraint, as it does not enforce\\nin-domain balance on each sequence. This flexibility allows experts to better specialize in\\ndifferent domains. To validate this, we record and analyze the expert load of a 16B auxiliary-\\nloss-based baseline and a 16B auxiliary-loss-free model on different domains in the Pile test set.\\nAs illustrated in Figure 9, we observe that the auxiliary-loss-free model demonstrates greater\\nexpert specialization patterns as expected.\\nTo further investigate the correlation between this flexibility and the advantage in model\\nperformance, we additionally design and validate a batch-wise auxiliary loss that encourages\\nload balance on each training batch instead of on each sequence. The experimental results show\\nthat, when achieving a similar level of batch-wise load balance, the batch-wise auxiliary loss\\ncan also achieve similar model performance to the auxiliary-loss-free method.

Our objective is\\nto balance the high accuracy of R1-generated reasoning data and the clarity and conciseness of\\nregularly formatted reasoning data.\\nTo establish our methodology, we begin by developing an expert model tailored to a specific\\ndomain, such as code, mathematics, or general reasoning, using a combined Supervised Fine-\\nTuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) training pipeline. This expert model serves as a\\ndata generator for the final model.

For questions that can be validated using specific rules, we adopt a rule-\\nbased reward system to determine the feedback. For instance, certain math problems have\\ndeterministic results, and we require the model to provide the final answer within a designated\\nformat (e.g., in a box), allowing us to apply rules to verify the correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode\\nproblems, we can utilize a compiler to generate feedback based on test cases. By leveraging\\nrule-based validation wherever possible, we ensure a higher level of reliability, as this approach\\nis resistant to manipulation or exploitation.\\nModel-Based RM. For questions with free-form ground-truth answers, we rely on the reward\\nmodel to determine whether the response matches the expected ground-truth.

Distillation from DeepSeek-R1\\nWe ablate the contribution of distillation from DeepSeek-R1 based on DeepSeek-V2.5. The\\nbaseline is trained on short CoT data, whereas its competitor uses data generated by the expert\\ncheckpoints described above.\\nTable 9 demonstrates the effectiveness of the distillation data, showing significant improve-\\nments in both LiveCodeBench and MATH-500 benchmarks. Our experiments reveal an inter-\\nesting trade-off: the distillation leads to better performance but also substantially increases the\\naverage response length. To maintain a balance between model accuracy and computational\\nefficiency, we carefully selected optimal settings for DeepSeek-V3 in distillation.\\nOur research suggests that knowledge distillation from reasoning models presents a promis-\\ning direction for post-training optimization. While our current work focuses on distilling data\\nfrom mathematics and coding domains, this approach shows potential for broader applications\\nacross various task domains. The effectiveness demonstrated in these specific areas indicates\\nthat long-CoT distillation could be valuable for enhancing model performance in other cogni-\\ntive tasks requiring complex reasoning. Further exploration of this approach across different\\ndomains remains an important direction for future research.\\n5.4.2. Self-Rewarding\\nRewards play a pivotal role in RL, steering the optimization process. In domains where verifica-\\ntion through external tools is straightforward, such as some coding or mathematics scenarios, RL\\ndemonstrates exceptional efficacy. However, in more general scenarios, constructing a feedback\\nmechanism through hard coding is impractical. During the development of DeepSeek-V3, for\\nthese broader contexts, we employ the constitutional AI approach (Bai et al., 2022), leveraging\\nthe voting evaluation results of DeepSeek-V3 itself as a feedback source. This method has\\n34'),\n",

By integrating additional constitutional inputs, DeepSeek-V3 can\\noptimize towards the constitutional direction. We believe that this paradigm, which combines\\nsupplementary information with LLMs as a feedback source, is of paramount importance. The\\nLLM serves as a versatile processor capable of transforming unstructured information from\\ndiverse scenarios into rewards, ultimately facilitating the self-improvement of LLMs. Beyond\\nself-rewarding, we are also dedicated to uncovering other general and scalable rewarding\\nmethods to consistently advance the model capabilities in general scenarios.\\n5.4.3. Multi-Token Prediction Evaluation\\nInstead of predicting just the next single token, DeepSeek-V3 predicts the next 2 tokens through\\nthe MTP technique. Combined with the framework of speculative decoding (Leviathan et al.,\\n2023; Xia et al., 2023), it can significantly accelerate the decoding speed of the model. A natural\\nquestion arises concerning the acceptance rate of the additionally predicted token. Based on\\nour evaluation, the acceptance rate of the second token prediction ranges between 85% and 90%\\nacross various generation topics, demonstrating consistent reliability. This high acceptance rate\\nenables DeepSeek-V3 to achieve a significantly improved decoding speed, delivering 1.8 times\\nTPS (Tokens Per Second).\\n6. Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Directions\\nIn this paper, we introduce DeepSeek-V3, a large MoE language model with 671B total pa-\\nrameters and 37B activated parameters, trained on 14.8T tokens. In addition to the MLA and\\nDeepSeekMoE architectures, it also pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing\\nand sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. The training of\\nDeepSeek-V3 is cost-effective due to the support of FP8 training and meticulous engineering op-\\ntimizations. The post-training also makes a success in distilling the reasoning capability from the\\nDeepSeek-R1 series of models. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DeepSeek-V3 has\\nemerged as the strongest open-source model currently available, and achieves performance com-\\nparable to leading closed-source models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Despite its strong\\nperformance, it also maintains economical training costs. It requires only 2.788M H800 GPU\\nhours for its full training, including pre-training, context length extension, and post-training.\\nWhile acknowledging its strong performance and cost-effectiveness, we also recognize that\\nDeepSeek-V3 has some limitations, especially on the deployment. Firstly, to ensure efficient\\ninference, the recommended deployment unit for DeepSeek-V3 is relatively large, which might\\npose a burden for small-sized teams. Secondly, although our deployment strategy for DeepSeek-\\nV3 has achieved an end-to-end generation speed of more than two times that of DeepSeek-V2,\\nthere still remains potential for further enhancement. Fortunately, these limitations are expected\\nto be naturally addressed with the development of more advanced hardware.\\nDeepSeek consistently adheres to the route of open-source models with longtermism, aiming\\nto steadily approach the ultimate goal of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). In the future, we\\nplan to strategically invest in research across the following directions.\\n• We will consistently study and refine our model architectures, aiming to further improve\\nboth the training and inference efficiency, striving to approach efficient support for infinite\\ncontext length. Additionally, we will try to break through the architectural limitations of\\nTransformer, thereby pushing the boundaries of its modeling capabilities.\\n35'),\n",

Results are smoothed by\\nExponential Moving Average (EMA) with a coefficient of 0.9.\\nB.1. FP8 v.s. BF16 Training\\nWe validate our FP8 mixed precision framework with a comparison to BF16 training on top of\\ntwo baseline models across different scales. At the small scale, we train a baseline MoE model\\ncomprising approximately 16B total parameters on 1.33T tokens. At the large scale, we train a\\nbaseline MoE model comprising approximately 230B total parameters on around 0.9T tokens.\\nWe show the training curves in Figure 10 and demonstrate that the relative error remains below\\n0.25% with our high-precision accumulation and fine-grained quantization strategies.\\nB.2. Discussion About Block-Wise Quantization\\nAlthough our tile-wise fine-grained quantization effectively mitigates the error introduced\\nby feature outliers, it requires different groupings for activation quantization, i.e., 1x128 in\\nforward pass and 128x1 for backward pass. A similar process is also required for the activation\\ngradient. A straightforward strategy is to apply block-wise quantization per 128x128 elements\\nlike the way we quantize the model weights. In this way, only transposition is required for\\nbackward. Therefore, we conduct an experiment where all tensors associated with Dgrad are\\nquantized on a block-wise basis. The results reveal that the Dgrad operation which computes\\nthe activation gradients and back-propagates to shallow layers in a chain-like manner, is highly\\nsensitive to precision. Specifically, block-wise quantization of activation gradients leads to\\n47'),\n",

These\\noutliers cannot be effectively managed by a block-wise quantization approach.\\nC. Expert Specialization Patterns of the 16B Aux-Loss-Based and Aux-Loss-\\nFree Models\\nWe record the expert load of the 16B auxiliary-loss-based baseline and the auxiliary-loss-free\\nmodel on the Pile test set. The auxiliary-loss-free model tends to have greater expert specializa-\\ntion across all layers, as demonstrated in Figure 10.\\n48'),\n",
